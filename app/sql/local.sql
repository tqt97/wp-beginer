Please do not install, run, or test this version of WordPress on production or mission-critical websites. Instead, it is recommended that you test RC1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.1 RC1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.1-RC1.zip\">RC1 version (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Use the following WP-CLI command:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>wp core update --version=6.1-RC1</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-1/\">6.1 release cycle is available

Anyone can take part in testing – regardless of prior experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about testing releases like this one? Read about the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">testing initiatives</a> that happen in Make Core. You can also join a <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-test/\">core-test channel</a> on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/\">Making WordPress Slack workspace</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have run into an issue, please report it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have with us today on the WordPress Briefing a couple of special guests. I have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ironprogrammer/\">Brian Alexander</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\">Anne McCarthy</a>. I&#8217;m gonna ask you both to tell us a little bit about yourselves, if you can tell us what you do with the WordPress project, maybe how long you&#8217;ve been with WordPress, and if there are any particular teams that you contribute to, that would be great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian, why don&#8217;t you get us started?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:01:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Brian. I work on the WordPress project as a full-time contributor, sponsored by Automattic. And I am one of the Test Team reps, so I help promote testing across the project. And that&#8217;s not just in Core, but it could be for Themes, Performance, feature plugins, what have you. So try to make that stuff move forward and wrangle as many people as we can to get on board and help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. All right, and Anne, what about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:01:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spearhead the Full Site Editing outreach program. I am a sponsor contributor for Automattic as well, and so I contribute across a couple of different teams depending upon what the outreach program needs as well as various release squads I have been a part of. So for 6.1 coming up, I&#8217;m one of the co-Core Editor triage leads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian is also on the squad as the co-Test lead, which is very exciting. So it&#8217;s been fun to work with him and be on the podcast. And I&#8217;ve been around the WordPress project since about 2011. But this is, the last couple of years, the first time I&#8217;ve been able to be sponsored by Automattic and be a part of giving back to the community that&#8217;s given me so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazing. All right. For folks who&#8217;ve been listening to the WP Briefing for a while, you know that I&#8217;ve been saying for like a full year that I think that testing is one of the best onboarding opportunities we have. And then also I really like to bring in our co-creators of WordPress through that testing program. Because we don&#8217;t know whether we&#8217;re right or not unless people tell us that we&#8217;re right or not. And we would like to hear so much from the users who, you know, use it and don&#8217;t necessarily have an opportunity, that privilege to kind of build on it or build the CMS itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I just have a few questions since I&#8217;ve got a couple of our strong testing wranglers here. The first thing I have is what are you doing? Or, do you have any advice for getting people outside of our active contributor base and the community to participate in testing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:03:03]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can kick this off. Just thinking about the Full Site Editing outreach program model. So just for context, there are various calls for testing in different formats. So everything from really procedural where you&#8217;re following exact steps to follow, to very open-ended calls for testing, as well as we recently did usability testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the things that come to mind immediately just for getting different contributors is to have very specific, fun, engaging, relevant tests that can draw people in. So if you have a call for testing that really speaks to someone, they might be more willing to participate. As well as just different formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So someone may not want to, you know, follow 30 steps, but they might want to follow something more open-ended. They might want to answer a survey rather than opening a GitHub link. And so I think a lot of facilitation with the outreach program has served us really well to bring in different folks as well as explicitly reaching out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve done a number of talks in different WordPress related spaces and non-WordPress spaces to try to tell people about what we&#8217;re up to and really go meet them where they are. Because I think that&#8217;s ultimately, especially with Covid and the pandemic, there was a really unique opportunity to do that and to join the random online meetup that was happening and talk about the program and talk about ways that people could get involved and feel heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:04:12]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the last thing I&#8217;ll mention is translations. The program that&#8217;s culture testing that I write is written in English, but I&#8217;m very fortunate to have people who translate those. And so that&#8217;s a huge way that I cannot contribute but that other people have. And so I really want to highlight that and call that out because it&#8217;s been hugely impactful to have these calls for testing in a way that people can more readily access.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:04:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I was going to add in, in addition to the calls for testing that are, as Anne said, structured such to isolate so that someone can just kind of go through a list of steps to do rather than just being exposed to Trac or GitHub and have kind of snow blindness with, with everything that&#8217;s happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a Week in Test series of posts that goes out about every week. And what we try to do with that series is to curate a list of posts that might be a good starting point. So we try to find one that, in each type of testing example, is something that would, a more novice contributor might be able to start with. Things for more intermediate and then also advanced ones that, for testers who may need to have a development environment and the ability to make some pretty deep or type of customizations to their WordPress project in order to test a patch or reproduce a particular issue that might be happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a good springboard for someone to come in where there&#8217;s just a small thing that they can kind of look at and then dive into the larger process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. That&#8217;s very smart. It&#8217;s hard to figure out how to get started in WordPress at all, let alone as a contributing by testing things sort of area. That feels new to WordPress even though the team has been around for a long time. And so I think that&#8217;s excellent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian, you mentioned in your note about who you are and what you&#8217;re doing that you&#8217;re helping with testing not only in the test section in the Test Team but then also across the project. So, I have a follow-up question for you. What can developers do to create better tests for their software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:06:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are sections within the Core handbook that kind of go into detail about the types of tests that should accompany individual contributions. A lot of those require kind of an extra step, and some developers maybe don&#8217;t have as much experience there. So hopefully, the Core handbook can provide a little bit of that guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a lot of contributors who are interested in things such as unit testing, E2E testing, which is end-to-end testing, and testing in JavaScript or in PHP. So there&#8217;s a wide variety of the types of tests that you can actually contribute to. And I would say maybe about 50% of the tickets that I&#8217;ve triaged, personally, the contributor who brought in the patch was unable to or was not familiar with providing unit tests. So that is a very good opportunity for someone to come in who maybe is not as well versed in the depth of what the patch was involved with. But by contributing a user test, they get an opportunity to look very focused at a particular piece of code, what was modified, and then create unit tests based on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:07:40]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then once that unit test has been submitted and starting to be reviewed, other reviewers, Core contributors, or Core committers, I would say, they&#8217;ll start looking at that and if there are additional details that should be there, expanding the tests or little modifications. Then that also is feedback to that test contributor so that the next time they come in, they&#8217;re more prepared for it. They&#8217;re learning more about Core, and eventually, maybe they&#8217;ll also become a Core contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:07]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. We will include links to these handbook pages and documentation in the show notes if you&#8217;re listening to the podcast on your favorite podcasting platform, Pocketcasts, or it&#8217;s somewhere else. I don&#8217;t know where people listen to podcasts, but if you&#8217;re listening to it somewhere that&#8217;s not on the website, you can come to get that on wordpress.org/news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, the next question that I have, and I think this is for both of you, Brian, it sounds like you partially answered it, but I bet there are more answers from Anne as well. What advice do you have for those submitting bug reports?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:08:38]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll chime in to start, and then Brian, I&#8217;d love to hear your unique take because I also think you do an excellent job whenever I&#8217;ve engaged with you in various places of providing really good replication steps. And so I love that, and I wanna offer things specific to WordPress itself and something that I&#8217;ve noticed that&#8217;s more cultural rather than necessarily like steps to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the things I&#8217;ve noticed that I think has started to come up partially with Covid is people, you know, you start talking at WordCamps or at a meetup, and a bug comes up, and you find someone who knows where to put it, and that kind of connection is has been frayed in the last couple years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so one of the things I feel like I&#8217;ve been saying to a lot of different people at this unique point in time is that it doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect. Don&#8217;t let perfect be the enemy of good. And so if it means you just need to drop it in a Slack channel and you just are like, I don&#8217;t know where to put this, that&#8217;s huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to hear from people across the project. And I just really encourage anyone, even if you don&#8217;t have the complete information or you&#8217;re not a hundred percent sure you&#8217;re afraid it&#8217;s been reported 10 times before, like, please still report it because we need those reports and also if 10 people reported it and it&#8217;s still not fixed, that also means we need to iterate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:09:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s one of the things, especially with the Full Site Editing outreach program, I feel people will message me saying, hey, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard this a bunch, but… And sometimes I&#8217;ve never heard it at all. And I shudder to think of all the people who have not reached out or have not posted in GitHub or Trac or wherever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, share, and write blog posts. I think that another great way that people can give feedback is if you don&#8217;t know how to get into the depths of WordPress, writing a post and talking about it and sharing it on social media is also a great way to get attention. I read a lot of those. But as much as possible, getting to, if you can, if you&#8217;re comfortable, getting to the source where we&#8217;re able to see it in Github or Trac goes a really long way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And share as much as you can. And don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t spend hours writing the perfect bug report, we still wanna hear from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:10:21]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Building off of what Anne said, just the fact that you&#8217;re speaking out and raising an issue is a huge step for many, many people. And once, once you&#8217;ve actually done that, as Anne said, it doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect. There are a lot of other people who are going to be looking at these bugs, trying to figure out the replication steps used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even if you can&#8217;t provide all this detail up front, someone will help. On the back end, they&#8217;ll help kind of fill in those gaps. If you do have the time to actually get deep into providing a very detailed bug report, then there are some key aspects of the bug report that make it very helpful for contributors, not only testers, who should be able to reproduce the issue to validate and make sure that this isn&#8217;t something that&#8217;s unique, unique to a plugin, to a custom theme or snippet that you dropped into your functions PHP.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, also for the actual Core contributors, who then need to be able to understand what is happening so that they can fix the right thing. And some of those items are the information about your testing environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:11:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that could be your browser, your server, the type, whether it&#8217;s Apache, Nginx, et cetera, the operating system you&#8217;re running, what version of PHP you&#8217;re running, the version of WordPress, very critical, and…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:49]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:11:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any themes and plugins that you&#8217;re using. And that kind of information helps set the stage, and then other people will be able to set up their environment similarly if they&#8217;re going to try to test it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you have provided the environmental information, the steps required to reproduce the issue should be as detailed as possible. You may not have realized that clicking this caused such and such to happen, so just try to remember, or maybe even walk through if it&#8217;s something you can repeat multiple times, walk through a couple of times and write down everything that you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:12:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that you&#8217;re sure, hey, this is the way that I can reproduce this bug. And then those steps will be very helpful for other contributors when they&#8217;re reviewing it. And then it&#8217;s also very helpful if you have video, screenshots, debug logs, any of those other kinds of resources that you could refer to because not all bugs are easy to explain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we tend to… Trac and GitHub issues for the Gutenberg project, everybody&#8217;s writing in English. And maybe your main language is not English, and it might be a little bit challenging to do that. So providing a video, it&#8217;s worth a thousand words in any language. So, if you can provide those types of assets, that&#8217;s also very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and I&#8217;ll share a little bit of a you&#8217;re-not-alone-in-it sort of anecdotes from the first few bugs that I ever filed for WordPress. I sort of had this feeling that if I were to file a bug, everyone would know that I wasn&#8217;t a developer. And like everyone knows, I&#8217;m not a developer, but a little bit I was like, they&#8217;ll know now. And so if that&#8217;s where you are also,&nbsp; Anne said it, and Brian said it as well, like, we can&#8217;t fix things that we don&#8217;t realize are broken. And just because you&#8217;ve run into it 15 times, which obviously should never happen, you should run into it once, and then we know, but it happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run into it 15 times, probably other people have as well. And if it&#8217;s still not fixed, it might be because no one has thought to themselves I should tell someone that&#8217;s broken. And so if that&#8217;s your primary hurdle, folks out there in our listening space, I was once there too. And honestly, knowing that it&#8217;s a problem is as valuable as knowing the solution to it most of the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:14:23]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and those are, I wanted to add, there is a lot to that to remember. That&#8217;s a lot to remember in terms of what you should be submitting, what, or I should say, what would be ideal in what you&#8217;re submitting. But luckily, in the test handbook, there&#8217;s a test report section, and it includes a description, it goes everything from, it starts with why we do bug reports to examples of the types of testing, whether it be for bugs or enhancements, which also need testing, and it has templates in there that you can copy and paste directly into Trac. And that&#8217;s very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah,, we will have links to those in the show notes as well. Since we&#8217;re right there at that moment, what do you think we could do as WordPress to make reporting problems easier?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:15:15]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that this has been something that&#8217;s come up during our weekly meetings, discussions on the Core test channel, as well as in contributor day test table discussions. And the test documentation that&#8217;s on the website is a little bit fragmented. I believe that the current test handbook was originally written for a type of flow analysis and feedback testing that is not the norm today. So it&#8217;s a little bit confusing. The terminology is a little dated, and the most recent updates that have been provided on there relate solely to Gutenberg, which is very important that that also be represented, but, in order to find information about testing and Trac or PHP unit tests, you have to go over to the core handbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we could definitely make things improved by consolidating, bringing everything into one area so that if you are interested in testing, you&#8217;ll have everything in one place and not be split between that and not have outdated methodologies that are asking you to submit videos that nobody&#8217;s going to really look at because we&#8217;re not doing the flow tests anymore. So I think that that would be a benefit to future testers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:41]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne, any thoughts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:16:43]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I&#8217;ll also add that I think there are like two things we can do. One is, there&#8217;s so much happening in the WordPress project in such a cool way that I think the more we can write targeted tests and talk to people about, like, hey, here&#8217;s this new thing coming. This is a high-impact area to test. It&#8217;s under active iteration. You&#8217;re gonna get a lot of engagement. People are really thinking about this and pulling people into that where you kind of get the momentum of getting the feedback in right when someone needs it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we could do that a bit more to make reporting problems easier because it&#8217;s kind of like you&#8217;re in the thick of it with a lot of people rather than maybe exploring an area where someone hasn&#8217;t looked at it in a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that’s the thing that comes to mind is just the more we can take the time. I think this release cycle has been really good with that, where there&#8217;s been a call for testing for fluid typography. There&#8217;s also been one for using block template parts and classic themes. And there&#8217;s a ton of stuff that&#8217;s been happening where we can kind of make these both developer and more end user testing experiences easier and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Brian has done a great job continuing the tradition of, you know, helping test this latest release cycle. And he&#8217;s taken those posts and done an amazing job of helping, having specific testing as well. Tied to this, I think just this has always been a thing but better, easier testing environments for developers and for quickly setting up more WordPress sites to test things for end users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:17:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Another thing that we have been discussing in Slack in the Core and Core Test channels is the possibility of pre-populating the Trac tickets. With a template based on what it is that you&#8217;re reporting. So similar to copying a template for a test report out of the handbook. Instead, you would hit a button to say the type of bug you are submitting, and then it would pre-populate that, and then you could fill in the gaps for that. This already happens over in Gutenberg. There, there are templates, and I find that that is very helpful. And so being able to do that in Trac would be useful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for reporting problems on the user side, I thought that it would be interesting to have like you have for any other modern app, a button that says Report Bug in WordPress that could capture some intelligence data for your installation, the page that you&#8217;re on and have a simple text box where you could provide a little description and then submit that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:19:08]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, these wouldn&#8217;t be the types of things that would just go straight into Trac, most likely. However, it would be an opportunity to allow end users to just send something in, and start having it looked at, rather than looking and saying, okay, I found a bug in WordPress. Now, what do I do?&nbsp; And then not reporting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that would be the worst case is that the bug just doesn&#8217;t get reported. So that would be information that is already harvested if you go to your site health screen and your WordPress installation. A lot of that information that would be useful is there. In this type of bug report, we would want to anonymize and strip a lot of that information out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of private stuff you don&#8217;t wanna share, but there is that data there that&#8217;s available that could potentially help in doing a bug report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:19:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brilliant. All right. Question for everyone in the room: what opportunities are there currently to help with testing? Anne, I know, and you already mentioned a few, we can just bombard everybody with links to the tests if we want. But yeah, what opportunities are currently out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:20:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ll mention the Full Site Editing outreach program. I&#8217;m very biased, but we&#8217;re always looking for new folks. We just crossed, I think, 600 people, which was unbelievable. So even if you&#8217;re not necessarily always able to help join the calls for testing, you can always pop into the FSE outreach experiment channel, which we&#8217;ll also add a link to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s just a great way when you have time to join because I flag stuff all the time, whether it&#8217;s about the outreach program or just in general across the project. Brian does really good weekly round-up testing posts as well. So make.wordpress.org/test is also a great place to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then right now, I think when this comes out, will be a great time to be helping test WordPress 6.1. So check out that post. I kind of wanna just shove everyone in that direction currently cause I think that&#8217;s the most high-impact thing to get involved with and one of the great ways to give back to the next version of WordPress to make it really delightful and easy to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m just gonna leave it there, even though there are so many ways you can help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 coming out on November 1st if you haven&#8217;t yet heard about it. Brian, what else have you got out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:21:16]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the online stuff, Anne covered that pretty well. I would say if you have a local WordCamp, sign up for their contributor day or if there are any local WordPress meetups. When Covid ended up hitting and lockdowns were rolled out, a lot of this stuff started to really slow down. So I think now is a good time to maybe introduce the idea for, hey, let&#8217;s have a local meetup, and for a couple of hours, we&#8217;ll just do some testing, and look at some stuff in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it might be a good way of getting people re-engaged. It&#8217;s a little bit lighter weight if you&#8217;re doing testing versus trying to actually provide a patch to fix an issue. So, might be a good way of bringing in some new faces and re-engaging people who we lost over the lockdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:22:09]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and if you all have never done a testing party for WordPress before, and it sounds like it&#8217;s maybe a really boring thing, it&#8217;s actually not, she said with strong authority and opinions. But also, I have never had a more successful learning experience with the WordPress CMS than when I was trying to figure it out with other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They see things that you don&#8217;t see, they know things you don&#8217;t know, and it really covers a lot of the bases for unknown unknowns when you&#8217;re trying to learn something. And then also you have all these people that like, we’re really in it with you, and everyone&#8217;s really pulling for each other, and it&#8217;s actually a bit more fun than it sounds like when you&#8217;re just like, a testing party. It turns into just like jointly solving a puzzle together, which I think sounds like a lot of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like a party, but for technology, I would feel this way. I am a mad extrovert, and we all know it, but. Now you two know it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:23:08]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a final, just like a fun question for you both, and if you have an answer, great. And if you don&#8217;t have an answer, I would be surprised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here we go. Last question of the day. If five more volunteers suddenly appeared to help on the Test Team, what would they do? Just, I waved a magic wand. I guess that&#8217;s what made it fun. I don&#8217;t know why. I was like, fun question and then I&#8217;m, like, assigned tasks that, Yeah, I waved a magic wand. That&#8217;s what made it fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:23:38]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I would say I would probably point them to FSE outreach program posts because…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:23:45]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woot woot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:23:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…the outreach program does a great job of outlining steps. You&#8217;re isolating testing in one particular area. It&#8217;s got a lot of tests. There&#8217;s examples of the types of feedback that you&#8217;re looking for, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a really good introduction to it, and most FSE testing does not require a local dev environment. Which is probably the biggest hurdle for a new tester coming in. If you do have developers with more experience, then they could start–and they wanted to look into Trac tickets or GitHub issues– then it does take a little bit of setup and you may spend the next few hours configuring your development environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead, I would recommend that you start with something like FSE outreach program posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:24:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did not pay Brian to say that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:24:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re just all partial to it here. That&#8217;s all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:24:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, we really are. Yeah, no, this is, I love this question, and I actually find it really fun cause I think about it a lot. And we&#8217;ve talked about some of this stuff too, and it&#8217;s something that when I think about five more people suddenly appearing, makes me giddy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we have folks, who have helped with like, I think I&#8217;ve mentioned like translations and group testing and even responding to questions that come from the channel and like, I just wish if we had five folks full time dedicated to that, I could see way more hallway hangouts where we casually talk about stuff and actually go on a call and talk live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could see folks, someone dedicated to helping translations and translating even more places. We have an Italian contributor who does it regularly, and a couple of Japanese contributors every once in awhile we get Spanish translation. But I&#8217;d love to see more translations to bring more people in, more facilitating group testing, more types of testing, helping me be more creative because sometimes I get a creative wall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But more than anything, if I really think long term about the project and thinking about this outreach program model, which I don&#8217;t think I fully appreciated how new it was, Josepha, when you introduced the idea, I think it would be so neat to bring in more folks to actually create new outreach programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:25:52]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe there&#8217;s an outreach program for theme authors or block theme authors, or maybe there&#8217;s an outreach program around collaborative editing. Like what does this look like, and how can we expand this to bring more people in? And I think a lot of that will prove the resiliency and lessons we&#8217;ve learned from Covid in the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can&#8217;t necessarily always rely on the meetup groups, so how can we meet people where they are? And I think there&#8217;s something really interesting and almost serendipitous that the outreach program started literally, I think it was like May 2020, like a couple of months into the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, like, I want to see it in a position of strength where we both have the in-person community alongside this outreach program model that can intertwine work. And I&#8217;d love to see the model expand to different types. And right now, maybe part of that is we use the outreach program model, the full site editing outreach program group itself, to experiment more and to keep that level of experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something I feel really strongly about is continuing to find what works and what doesn&#8217;t. And so if we had five more people, I could just, I&#8217;d probably go wild and have all sorts of cool, cool things and spinoffs, but I&#8217;m more introverted than Josepha, so there&#8217;s limitations to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:56]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you heard it here first. If you&#8217;re one of my 6,000 listeners. I only need five of one of you. Five of the ones of you to come and make Anne&#8217;s whole life an exciting joy for the next 12 months. So, I only need five of you and I know that you&#8217;re out there. There are 2000 or something, 6,000. I have no idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got more than 1000 of you listening, and I know that you wanna come and help Anne cuz she&#8217;s a delight. I know you wanna come help Brian cuz he&#8217;s a delight. Both of you. This was such a fun conversation. Thank you for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:27:29]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, Josepha. Thank you, Anne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:27:31]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:27:33]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there it is a bit of a deep dive on the Test Team and how to get started on it. Like I mentioned, we&#8217;ll have a ton of links in the show notes over on wordpress.org/news. And I wanna remind folks that if you have questions or thoughts that you&#8217;d like to hear from me about, you can always email us at WPbriefing@wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. First and foremost, we are counting down the days to the WordPress 6.1 release. We are within a month of the target release date. So if you have not tested the latest version with your plugins or themes, now is the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, we are seeing translated tutorials being submitted on learn.wordpress.org. I&#8217;m delighted to see that happening, and I encourage any polyglots out there who feel called to consider translating one into your language and help other people feel empowered to use WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing is that the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India just concluded, so to celebrate, we&#8217;ve opened registrations for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in Latin America. Unlike the last one, this event takes place in person on October 29th. And so I&#8217;ll include a link to registrations for that in the show notes as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosey, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13551\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"WordPress 6.1 Beta 2 Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/wordpress-6-1-beta-2-now-available/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 18:12:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13533\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:306:\"WordPress 6.1 Beta 2 is now available for download and testing.\n\nThis version of the WordPress software is under development.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For folks who are new to WordPress in the past couple of years, you may have heard people talk about WordPress events with a sort of passion that really is hard to describe. For me, I know our events are the dark matter of what makes this global, fully distributed, multifaceted project come together so well in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also know that WordPressers have so many different reasons for coming together. So we took a little wander through WordCamp US to get their take on why they use WordPress and also why they go to WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordCamp US is back in person for the first time since 2019. What are you most excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:01:19]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Topher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing everyone, the interpersonal relationships, the communication, the expressions on people&#8217;s faces that you don&#8217;t get via email or Slack or whatever. Just being near people again and enjoying each other&#8217;s company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jen Miller 00:01:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Jen Miller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was most excited to see my friends. It&#8217;s been a long time to try to maintain connections via social media and, you know, texting and phone calls. But being here and being a part of the WordPress community has made everything great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:01:54]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney Robertson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributor day, of course, that&#8217;s how I got really connected to the WordPress community. And I am hoping we have a great turnout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How long have you been a contributor to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Kathy Drewien 00:02:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Kathy Drewien.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started in 2008 by attending my first WordCamp. Two years later, I was part of the organizing team for WordCamp Atlanta. I have been on that team for one role or another. Well, I can&#8217;t tell you how many years now. From then, until now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Stine 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Alex Stine. About six years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 12 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started going to WordCamp, then working in the support forums, and just grew from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started checking guests in, at my first WordCamp in 2009, which I see as one avenue of contributing. I joined a team officially in 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:02:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Courtney Patubo Kranzke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been an on-and-off contributor to WordPress since like the mid-2000s, but I&#8217;ve been a sponsored contributor since 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin Hartzler </strong><strong>00:03:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Dustin Hartzler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started a WordPress podcast in 2010. And I did like 500 episodes in a row without a break and without a week worth of rest. So I consider that my contribution to WordPress. I have a couple of core contributions, like I, I fixed a little bug here, a little bug there in a couple of releases, I think back in the four eras, 4.1 or 4.2 or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2010 is when I really got started in giving back, and, like, sharing my knowledge with the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:03:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is it important for you to attend WordCamps or contribute to the WordPress project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Ricardas Kudirka </strong><strong>00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Ricardas Kudirka.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, for everyone who&#8217;s using WordPress, it&#8217;s really important to understand how big the community is that we have here. So the community is an important and crucial part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for it to grow, you need to attend the WordCamps, you need to share knowledge, and you need to meet people. So networking here and while meeting the exciting people who are developing WordPress or who are contributing to it, who are providing the services, who enable people to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a crucial point for everyone to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Kathy Drewien </strong><strong>00:04:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to attend them because it&#8217;s very hard to describe them. We are not like any other thing you have ever done in your life. You have to be here to get it. And then once you get it, you wanna do more of it. It&#8217;s magical. It&#8217;s magical. There&#8217;s no way to get that experience without being here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of contributing, it&#8217;s a responsible thing to do. You want to give back instead of get, get, get. In the beginning, we&#8217;re all about the get, get, get. And then you go, oh my gosh. I didn&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t know I could do this. I didn&#8217;t know I had to write code. I can actually just stand around and talk to people and contribute to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Jen Miller </strong><strong>00:04:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s a community effort, and so if we want it to progress and grow, we need to put our own individual effort into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, we make friends, we make connections, and we find people who we can help and who can help us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:05:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel it is important to support the community that got me my start in technology and make sure that people understand that accessibility is very much a requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we need to make sure we keep the community inclusive for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:05:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is your favorite way to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:05:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with WordPress as a personal blogger. So it continues to be my favorite way to use WordPress. But, my use has evolved to using it for work as well as a place to share my photography and food blogging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Robertson </strong><strong>00:05:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is through the Training team. Most of the things that I write these days are on make.wordpress.org/training and or learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love teaching people about WordPress, helping people at all skill levels advance, and that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find me around the WordPress Training team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin&nbsp; Hartzler </strong><strong>00:05:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is just building cool things. Like I have a website, my wife has a couple of websites, and me just trying to learn things and trying to do them myself. Yesterday, there was a session, a 15-minute long session, and I learned how to customize the options available for different core WordPress blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that you could just make a button and like make a default like here&#8217;s the style for the default button. So every button&#8217;s exactly the same on the site. Like how cool is that? I like the side of customizing WordPress to make it easier for people who are non-techy like me to use my site, like my wife, and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:06:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you use WordPress in your day-to-day life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Topher </strong><strong>00:06:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s sort of a universal tool for me. I blog, and I do podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoy drinking whiskey, so I built a rating system for it. And I use it as a notepad, a scratch pad. I use it as my photography backup system. Just kind of as a universal tool for everything</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:06:53]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I currently am one of the Accessibility team reps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a core contributor, Guttenberg contributor, the occasional meta contributor, and the occasional training team contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:07:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, if that doesn&#8217;t convince you to go to a WordCamp or start your own meetup group, I just don&#8217;t know what will. Big thanks to everyone who sat down with us there in San Diego.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:23]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing, WordPress Global Translation Day is coming up next week on September 28th. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the hard work that goes into translating all of this software for folks all around the world. If you want to learn more about how you could contribute to translations, I&#8217;ll have a link in the show notes for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WooSesh is coming up on October 11th through 13th, 2022. This one is not an in-person event. It&#8217;s a WPSessions event, but it specifically talks about how to get some eCommerce going on your WordPress site. So if you&#8217;ve been thinking about how to get a shop on your site, or just making your current shop a bit more complicated, then this is the event for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on our list today is All Things Open. They are hosting a hybrid event this year from October 31st through November 2nd. This event isn&#8217;t specific to WordPress, but it is specific to open source and one of the best resources for learning some OSS basics. So if you&#8217;ve been interested in learning more about how this whole open source thing is an idea that will change our generation, then set your sights on that event. I will have a link in the show notes there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13481\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"Dropping security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/dropping-security-updates-for-wordpress-versions-3-7-through-4-0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13466\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:343:\"As of December 1, 2022 the WordPress Security Team will no longer provide security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping people who are new to WordPress learn how to make the most out of their CMS used to be one of the most clearly impactful things I ever did as a contributor. Whether it was making sure a brand new installation simply worked, or if the original setup needed to grow along with a solopreneur&#8217;s growing business needs, I found great joy in seeing how my local community was learning new tools together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard me talk about the Learn WP initiative or the training team on this podcast before, but you might still be a little shy to get started with the team. So I have invited one of their team reps today to talk through what the team does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. I have with us today Hauwa Abashiya. She is one of the team reps for the training team and also works on the learn.wordpress.org site. Thank you for joining me today, Hauwa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:01:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thank you for having me, Josepha, quite exciting to be on your podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I, you know, when we were talking about doing this topic, I was like, you know, who would be an excellent person is Hauwa. Like you were such an interesting person to work with when we were working on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">5.6 release</a>. And then also, you just have such a lovely way of explaining the complicated things that we have going on in WordPress and especially on the training side of things. And so you were the first person that came to mind for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of all the learn.wordpress.org things, you&#8217;ve been contributing to the WordPress project as a team rep for the training team for a bit. But that&#8217;s not really where you started. Can you tell me a bit about how you found your way to this team?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:15]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I started by attending a WordCamp, and that was WordCamp Brighton. And if anyone&#8217;s read my <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-my-global-family/\">article on HeroPress</a>, then they will know that I learned WordPress in one week. Went through beginner sessions of it. And then, I was like, yeah, let me just go turn up and see what it&#8217;s like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So turned up, and I met some wonderful people there. One of them being <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/miss_jwo/\">Jenny Wong</a>, who introduced me to the London meetup team. So, I then went there. They were looking for volunteers because they were planning WordCamp London for 2019. And me being me, I was like, yeah, sure. Why not? And got thrown into the deep end, but no, an amazing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got to meet some really amazing people. And yeah, just went from there then, you know, because I was doing stuff with WordCamp London, ended up going to WordCamp Europe. And I think there&#8217;s probably quite a lot of people who say they fully got into contributing in WordCamp Europe. So I was doing little bits and pieces then on like, marketing team and then met <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jessecowens/\">Jesse [Owens]</a>  at the training team cause <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">Abha Thakor</a> introduced me to him and just went from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in terms of team rep, I mean, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/courane01/\">Courtney Robertson</a> sent out SOS, because Learn had just launched, and there were a couple of things that we needed. So that was during the soft launch. And I was like, yeah, sure. I&#8217;ll help you. I&#8217;m not doing much. And that&#8217;s how I ended up doing team rep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that so many initial stories in the WordPress community start with like, well, I went to a WordCamp cause I was like, what in the world is this? And then people were like, we need some help. And I thought to myself, what else am I doing? Like, so many stories start that way. And I just love it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you mentioned learn.wordpress.org. That is a part of the training team in the WordPress project. Correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So can you give us an idea of the difference between the two? Cause like normally, with a project as big as Learn, you would expect to see like a whole separate team. But these are two intertwined teams using two intertwined concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so can you give us an idea of the difference between them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:29]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I like to see learners, that&#8217;s the content. So it&#8217;s the content that we have on the platform, and the training team wrangles all the content on Learn. So that would be like your videos, your lesson plans, and online workshops. Yeah, so we wrangle the content that&#8217;s on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We try to bring a lot of different teams together, and that&#8217;s one of the things the beauty, I think, of Learn is that there is a lot of cross-team collaboration, which started from the beginning and I think just will continue and get better and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And the workshops, those are once a week, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:05:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So you have online workshops, which used to be called social learning spaces, which used to be called discussion groups. So those run once a week. There&#8217;s a number running, and there are some that are launching in Japan. And I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/bsanevans/\">Ben Evans</a> has been quite key in getting quite a lot of those going, and I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/piyopiyofox/\">Destiny Kanno</a> as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s the beauty is you get to see a lot more languages coming up. Those run once a week. And then we obviously have lesson plans, which traditionally that&#8217;s what the training team used to always make for Meetup organizers. So if you didn&#8217;t have a speaker, you could go and get a lesson plan and run through something, or anybody could pick one up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they are used mainly by like our Meetup users and then people who are running any boot camps or sessions, or you wanna just take somebody through WordPress and teach them, you can pick one up and run through it. And now we&#8217;ve got courses on Learn, which is quite exciting. Got a couple of courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know there&#8217;s about three or four courses in development. There is a bit more WordPress development based rather than user based. There&#8217;s a fourth piece of content, and that is just the general workshop. So tutorials, I think no tutorials is what we&#8217;re calling them now. So there&#8217;s like all our online videos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tell you terminology in any project, the age and size of WordPress is hard to keep everything straight, but especially when you&#8217;ve just changed it you&#8217;re like, what do we call it though?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I understand correctly, because as you mentioned, like you have this post up on HeroPress, you don&#8217;t actually come from a training background. Like you aren&#8217;t a teacher or corporate trainer or anything, but you have really committed to contributing to the training team and to learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, from your perspective, from like the, I&#8217;m not a trainer perspective, what&#8217;s the most exciting thing for learn.wordpress.org in the near future?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:58]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s the collaboration. It&#8217;s the potential that Learn has. So I don&#8217;t have a training background, but interestingly enough, I come from Kaduna, Nigeria. And Kaduna cause all the states in Nigeria have a tagline, and, Kaduna is actually the center of learning. So there must be some link there, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think the beauty of that is you don&#8217;t have to have a training background. You can come in and impart your knowledge, and there are people available in the team that can help you impart that knowledge. So if it&#8217;s like a lesson plan that you wanna draw up, we&#8217;ve got people that can help and assist in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you wanna run an online workshop. There are people that can assist you. And I think that&#8217;s also the beauty of WordPress is that we&#8217;re all there to help each other. So just seeing that and seeing how, as time has gone on how the team has actually just been growing cause more and more people are coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with that, you&#8217;ve got more of like the different languages coming in, and I know we might touch on that later, but it&#8217;s, I think to me, that is the beauty that anyone can actually now come in and learn. And Learn as this platform that is accessible to everybody. So it&#8217;s not necessarily behind a, like a paywall or anything, which is, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, but there are people that it&#8217;s like, well, okay, you can access something by the community for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think like your last thought there, something that&#8217;s by the community for the community. That&#8217;s one of the things that I noticed early on about the WordPress community. So I&#8217;ve been in the WordPress community for a long time, but when I started doing the administrative back office, things that are invisible and no one wants to know about, because it&#8217;s boring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started doing that work, one of the things I noticed and that I really treasure the most about the WordPress community is that they want to do things together. They want to look at the problem together. They want to find a solution together. And a lot of times they just want to learn together as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see that there is a real, I don&#8217;t know, not, it&#8217;s not a safety and numbers question. I think it is a long-standing feeling that we can all kind of get further together and that we are better together. And so I like your thought there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned, though, translations, and I know that this came up at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t actually have a lot of translated content on learn.wordpress.org. There&#8217;s some technical issues that exist there, but are there a few languages that we already are sort of seeing translated courses for? Translated lessons for?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:09:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So we have a couple in Hindi, I believe. And I know we&#8217;ve got some Greek translations that have been coming up, so I know, I think it was last year WordCamp India, during contributor day, we had quite a lot of people translating stuff then, and I suppose the online WordCamps that we&#8217;ve been able to rank. Cause I think our first like face to face is this year, so they didn&#8217;t do that much translation there, but we&#8217;ve seen an increase in people wanting to translate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think those are the ones that come to mind. And I know Japanese, I think that was just recently, in the last two weeks, somebody&#8217;s translated one or two of the tutorials have been translated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we’re getting more and more requests coming through. And I know we kind of touched on this in our earlier discussion, but it&#8217;s like, how do you manage that? Cause you&#8217;re right, we don&#8217;t have a way to easily manage polyglots on Learn at the moment or WordPress in general. But I think seeing that, and I keep saying to people, I don&#8217;t wanna lose that engagement cause if you&#8217;ve got the people engaged, let them just do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t normally say this, but let them do it, and we&#8217;ll figure out how to sort out the whole pile when it comes in later. Because you kind of don&#8217;t want to lose them because I feel like if we say, no, we&#8217;ll wait until that comes in, we&#8217;ll lose a lot of the engagement. And come that time, people will be like, oh no, I&#8217;m not that interested. Or it might be an even more effort to try and bring more people on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:18]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s always a struggle, like wanting to be able to get something good out without insisting that it be perfect. Like that whole perfect is the enemy of the good sort of concept.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Mm-hmm&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we were talking about this way back in June, I was like, I obviously would love to get a perfect solution out immediately, but like, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, do we just be if you don&#8217;t speak English, you cannot learn here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that&#8217;s not fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want everyone to be able to learn here in their own languages, and yeah. That&#8217;s just a living, breathing issue with a global project, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we left us on like a really juicy topic, just the lightest thing we could find. Is there anything else that you wanna be sure to share with the WordPress Briefing listeners before we head out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:12:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come and join the training team. Like I said, you don&#8217;t have to be a trainer. You can come in, and help us take notes. You can come in and edit, and review. If you are a subject matter expert, we also have the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/faculty-program/\">faculty program</a>, which was launched. Was it a month ago now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry. Days, months, weeks merge for me these days. But yeah, so that&#8217;s like a dedicated volunteer team. And in there, we&#8217;ve got content creators, editors, subject matter experts, and just admin stuff. If you wanna help us with the admin stuff. If you&#8217;re a GitHub guru, get in touch cause we are trying to automate some of our processes, and we could use the help, but yeah, just come join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join one of our meetings, which run on Tuesdays at 7 AM UTC and 4:00 PM UTC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right. I get my time right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it&#8217;s not right, we&#8217;ll put it. We&#8217;ll correct it in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you are not necessarily familiar with the WordPress project and how to get started with contributions, you can find the training team and a lot of information about them and all the other teams on make.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will share that in the show notes as well. make.wordpress.org/training is where you can find Hauwa&#8217;s team. Hauwa, thank you again for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:13:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, thank you for having me. It&#8217;s just a wonderful treat. I get to listen to you, and now I get to be on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, it&#8217;s good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that some of you feel inspired to stop by and see what the team is up to learn something new about WordPress or contribute a little something yourself. And with that, I&#8217;ll bring us home with the small list of big things. First thing, there was a freshly pressed minor release last week. You probably didn&#8217;t notice it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It probably went quite smoothly in the background and never interrupted you at all. However, if you want to read what was in it, you can head to wordpress.org/news now, or click on the link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second thing, is that coming up at the end of this week, September 9th, 2022, WordCamp US is back and ready to help broaden your WordPress knowledge. If you will be there, I hope it is a wonderful time, but if you won&#8217;t be there in person, I&#8217;ll include a link to register for the live stream, or you can watch all of those sessions afterward on wp.tv or the WordPress YouTube channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third thing on our list of small list of big things is that WordPress Translation Day is coming up. That&#8217;s normally at the end of September, it coincides with a global day of appreciation for translators just generally across the world. And so that is coming, it&#8217;s normally around the 28th or so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So put that in your calendars. As soon as I have any information, as soon as I have a link to share with you all, I will have that for you as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing on my list today is that if you are hoping to speak at WordCamp Asia, 2023, you have 10 more days, September 15th, 2022**, to apply for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need topics of all sorts, from security hardening and backend development to entrepreneurial best practices, WordPress out of the box all the way back around to the importance of securing open source freedom. Even when people don&#8217;t know they need them. If you&#8217;ve got something you&#8217;re a bit passionate about, something that you are a passionate expert about especially, we want to see your application. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>** <em><strong>Special note: the deadline to apply as a speaker to WordCamp Asia was extended to September 30th, 2022, after the recording of this episode.</strong></em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13425\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"People of WordPress: Bud Kraus\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/08/people-of-wordpress-bud-kraus/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 21:30:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13385\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"The latest People of WordPress story features trainer Bud Kraus, from the United States, talking about the software and how he uses it.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14109:\"\n<p><strong>This month, as we approach <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2022/\">WordCamp US</a>, we feature Bud Kraus, a WordPress trainer who has made a career in helping others learn about software.

He was determined not to let his sight difficulties stop him from his wish to  help others learn website building and maintenance skills.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress evolves and new features release, Bud decided to extend his training services around helping new and existing users improve and practice their skills. He supports others in open source through volunteering to speak at WordPress events, and encourages others to do so too. He also gives time to help produce material for the free-to-access resource <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress,</a> which is part of the WordPress.org project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a contributor to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">Test</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">Training</a> teams, Bud is keen for others to try contributing to these areas and help support the project&#8217;s future development. One of his current training priorities is to help people with using the block editor and Full Site Editing. He is an advocate for the usability of WordPress today, saying: “I can design all aspects of a website now with a block.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using WordPress as a traditional developer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud’s WordPress journey began with a lunch at Grand Central Station in New York in 2009. A friend and former client was promoting the idea of using WordPress, which Bud initially resisted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m a code guy…,” he told his friend at the time. “I will never use anything like that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the friend persisted. Eventually, Bud gave it a try and found a new approach with things called themes and plugins. His first encounter was with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/\">WordPress 2.6</a>. Bud signed up with a hosting company and found a theme where he could learn to edit and understand child themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Once I saw that you could edit anything and make it yours, I was hooked. The endorphins were freely coursing through my veins.&#8221; Bud was hooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Teaching WordPress strengthens your own understanding of the software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an old saying that the best way to learn something new is to turn around and teach someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud was already an instructor at the Fashion Institute of Technology when he thought, “I could teach WordPress!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so he did, packing classrooms all through those first years of WordPress as it swept through the design world and further.<br><br>But Bud had more to discover. He said: &#8220;Two big things were about to happen that were really going to change my life. They would show me the way to the WordPress community – not that I even knew what that was.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sharing lessons learnt with the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, one of his students suggested he start going to the New York WordPress Meetup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he started going to WordCamps in New York City, he realized that WordPress was getting very large. What’s more, it had a community of people with whom he felt at home and could learn alongside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud gave a talk for the first time in 2016 at the only WordCamp to this day that has been held at the United Nations. He shared his knowledge of “Lessons Learned: Considerations For Teaching Your Clients WordPress.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"952\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=952%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus talking at a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-13340\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?w=952&amp;ssl=1 952w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=279%2C300&amp;ssl=1 279w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=768%2C826&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Bud Kraus speaks at WordCamps to help people use the software even more effectively</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, Bud went on to speak at other WordCamps in the US. He also volunteered as a speaker wrangler for his home camp in New York City in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From speaking to writing about WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point before the Covid-19 lockdown, Bud found another outlet, this time in writing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud heard a magazine was advertising for submissions related to WordPress.&nbsp;His first attempted article did not make the cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in his second submission, Bud took the risk of writing about something deeply personal – a topic he really didn’t want to write about at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He gathered his courage and revealed to the entire web design world that he was legally blind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article appeared as&nbsp; <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/using-low-vision-teach-wordpress/\"><strong>Using Low Vision As My Tool To Help Me Teach WordPress</strong></a><strong>”.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"510\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=510%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus\" class=\"wp-image-13426\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?w=510&amp;ssl=1 510w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=255%2C300&amp;ssl=1 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bud Kraus</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the age of 37, Bud has had macular degeneration in both eyes, which affects his central vision. It is a leading cause of legal blindness in the United States and many other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He relies on his peripheral vision and finding ways to compensate. He also tends to see things in a flat dimension and has a difficulty discerning contrast&nbsp; &#8211; he&nbsp; is glad there are starting to be improvements in color contrasts in web design!<br><br>He uses tools like Speech to Text, larger sized cursors and bigger font sizes, and heavily uses zooming back in and out when working with WordPress. He is able to recognize patterns but has to rely on detailed preparation and memorizing materials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his first magazine article acknowledging this situation, he shared the added difficulties that technology creates for people with visual conditions, and tips that he had found to try and find alternative routes around them. He uses the technique of finding alternatives in his training work to help people learn and understand, realizing that all people have different ways of reading and understanding. His words and subsequent stories have inspired others and enabled more people to highlight accessibility. He describes himself as a ‘stakeholder in ensuring that the WordPress admin is accessible.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year after its first publication, the piece became a WordCamp talk, ‘My Way with WordPress.’ The talk was a hit and started many conversations about accessibility and the importance of raising awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, he gave a Gutenberg talk at the first WordCamp Montclair. There was no way he could have done it from a laptop, so instead, he did it from his 27” desktop computer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud said: &#8220;It was a presentation on Gutenberg plugins. Since I couldn’t do this from a notebook screen (the screen is too small and the keyboard is hard for me to manipulate), it was decided that I would bring in my 27″ desktop machine to a WordCamp. I’m probably the first person to ever have done this. It was good thing I only lived a few miles away.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I sat behind my computer, did my thing, and every once in a while peered out to make sure people were still there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Different ways of contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main ways Bud supported the community around the software was through talks at WordCamps and helping others to speak. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, he was keen to continue contributing when WordCamps were no longer meeting in person.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is one of my favorite niche holidays &#8211; World Wide Web Day &#8211; which serves to raise awareness about the origins of the World Wide Web project. WordPress, as part of Web 2.0, only ever had a chance to exist because the web, as we have come to know it exists. So in order to mark this nerdy day on the WP Briefing, I invited a number of community members to share a bit about how WordPress has been a part of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, let&#8217;s do some introductions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:01:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/awarner20/\">Adam Warner</a>, and I&#8217;m originally from a small town in west Michigan, now residing in Orlando, Florida.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:01:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/\">Alice Orrù</a>. I&#8217;m Italian. I was born in the beautiful island of Sardinia, but I&#8217;ve been living in Spain in the province of Barcelona for 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal 00:01:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/thewebprincess/\">Dee Teal</a>; Dee is short for Denise. I&#8217;m from New Zealand, but I live In Melbourne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:01:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, my name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/femkreations/\">Femy Praseeth</a>. I was born and raised in India and now live in San Jose, California, with my family and cuddly Doodle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:01:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jillbinder/\">Jill Binder</a>, and I&#8217;ve just moved back to Vancouver, Canada.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:01:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/mariaojob/\">Mary Job</a>. I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2015, and I&#8217;m from Nigeria. I&#8217;m from the Western part of Nigeria. Ijebu precisely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:01:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/onealtr/\">Oneal Rosero</a>. I am from the Philippines and I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2007.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe</strong> <strong>00:02:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamsirotee/\">Theophilus Adegbohungbe</a> . And I&#8217;m from Ilesa, Osun State in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:02:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ugyensupport/\">Ugyen Dorji</a> and I&#8217;m from Bhutan. And I&#8217;m working with WordPress for more than five years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I enjoy the most about being part of any community is being able to see how people change and grow over time as they learn and gain confidence in their own expertise. So a favorite early question is naturally, ‘How has WordPress changed your World?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:02:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress changed my world in many ways. But, uh, starting from the moment, it allowed me to become part of a global connected and welcome community. I started using WordPress as a blogger many, many years ago, but it was in 2015 that I started working behind the scenes of WordPress with a plugin company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was the moment when everything changed, basically, because I realized that WordPress was much more than a CMS for creating websites. It was a world full of opportunities for networking, making new friends and walking a new professional path as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:03:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During one interview, I was asked many questions about WordPress and although I had a basic understanding of WordPress, I struggled to give detailed answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that interview, I resolved to develop my skills and learn as much about WordPress as possible. A few months passed and I received a call from ServeMask In, [who] had developed a plugin called All-in-One WP Migration plugin. They offered me a position which fulfilled my wish to work with WordPress full time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because of that, I am now an active contributor to the WordPress community as bread and butter, with the best career in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:04:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are very familiar with my country, Nigeria things here, it&#8217;s not as smooth as it is in other parts of the world. That is, when you are done in school in my university, you have to find means of surviving yourself.&nbsp; There is nothing like the government have work for you. There is nothing like you finish our institution and you get job instantly. So it&#8217;s very tough here. And, year by year, schools keep producing graduates with no companies to employ them and no government job again as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I personally, I was able to gain freedom from this with the help of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:04:51]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress completely changed my work life. I started working independently. I started freelancing with agencies and designers and, uh, building websites from their web designs. And this was around the time my son was born. Actually, he was in elementary school and I think this was around 2014 or so. I started working remotely when remote was not even a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there were very few companies that let you work from home and remote was not a mainstream thing at all, but with WordPress, I could set my own working hours while my son was in school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:29]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, my preferred follow-up question of, ‘How did you hear about us?’ or ‘How did you connect to this global community?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:05:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, actually what I love about WordPress is that it&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s not a business. It&#8217;s not a company. It&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s a community that&#8217;s always ready to help support, teach and encourage people. That&#8217;s how I felt when I joined the community. There&#8217;s always somebody who has your back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s always somebody who&#8217;s going to guide you. There&#8217;s always an expert who will take your hand and lead you into the beauty that is WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:06:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way that I connect with the global community these days are one, of course, is .org Slack. Another of course is Twitter as there&#8217;s a very active WordPress community there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with WordCamps all over the globe. I&#8217;m lucky enough to have been able to travel to several hundred WordCamps through the years in the US and abroad. And that&#8217;s one of the most rewarding parts is meeting people from all over the world and you see really how small and the world really is and how similar we really all are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:06:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, not until 2020. I don’t know if you know this lady, a very vibrant lady in WordPress. She&#8217;s from Nigeria; her name is Mary Job, and she&#8217;s really promoting WordPress here. So it was through her that I got to know about the community. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:06:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My work is the global WordPress community. So we hold our three programs for the global WordPress community, and we are always trying to reach more and more countries. For quite a while, it was very North America-heavy, and then I made some efforts to expand. And it&#8217;s very exciting that this year, some contributors in our team have actually launched an Asia Pacific branch of our group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we have two meetings every other week where we have the America/Europe and the APAC, and we&#8217;ve also been able to reach other countries as well, but we typically reach something like between 20 and 50 countries a year, depending on the year. So a hundred percent global. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How has WordPress, either the CMS or the project, made you feel more connected? And are there any surprising connections that came from WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal&nbsp; 00:07:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess the surprising connections I think that have come from WordPress have been the fact that I feel like I&#8217;ve got friends all over the world. And a lot of those have come out of community involvement and from contributing. That I could go to a, a meetup pretty much anywhere in the world and probably find somebody I know, or at least a second degree connection of somebody that I haven&#8217;t, you know, that I might not have met, but know somebody that I know. And certainly that happens fairly regularly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:08:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress. The WordPress project, the community, has made me feel connected in a huge way, because I am literally surrounded by everything WordPress. So I like how, when you meet somebody who does WordPress, there&#8217;s this instant, ‘Oh, we&#8217;re brothers,’ or&nbsp; ‘Oh, we&#8217;re sisters!’ You know? There&#8217;s that feeling? That&#8217;s how I feel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see somebody who does WordPress, as I do, I&#8217;m like, ‘Oh yeah, we&#8217;re, kin.’ You know? We are family. That&#8217;s how I feel when I meet people who do WordPress. And I&#8217;ve met quite a number of people who do WordPress from like around the world. Like I have a friend here, he&#8217;s from the Benin Republic, and we host started a dinner on Friday night and one of my guests was asking me, ‘How did you guys meet?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, ‘Oh yeah, we work in the same WordPress ecosystem.’ He attended our WordCamp, we became friends, and we just literally became really good friends. So I have tons of people that I&#8217;ve met like that I hold in high esteem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:09:12]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Meetups are the seeds that lead to the growth of WordPress communities. WordCamp is a platform for plugin and theme developers to meet WordPress users and website developers. It&#8217;s a great environment where many incredible discussions about WordPress takes place. With each WordCamp there is a &#8220;tribe&#8221; meeting, where I think people [can] get more connected. It&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity for aspiring computer engineers, generators and get to showcase their talent and meet each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:09:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the project level, it has given me the opportunity to feel like an active part of a global project. The idea that I can give my contribution to making the web a better place &#8211; it’s amazing. And I do so with the Translation team, so making WordPress accessible to all the people that use the core plugins and themes in Italian, and prefer to do that in Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What area of the WordPress world is most important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:10:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a little bit of a passion for diversity in tech and diversity in WordPress, specifically around events. And so, here&#8217;s a chance to name the three programs that we&#8217;ve been working on this year. So as mentioned a few times, we have our <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/\">Diverse Speaker Workshop</a> that helps people go from not even having the thought that people could step up on stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second program is because of the pandemic. There was no longer the straight path from taking our workshop to speaking, because we used to hold them or people used to hold them for their WordCamps and meetups. And so it was like, okay, you&#8217;ve taken. Apply for our next WordCamp or meetup. But during the pandemic, that wasn&#8217;t a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have this amazing channel that we welcome everyone to join, allies and people from underrepresented groups who are interested in speaking or interested in supporting people and speaking. And that&#8217;s the Diverse Speaker channel <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C028SE81N3H\">diverse-speaker-support</a> channel on the Make WordPress slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third program is, and we, we went through a name change recently. So I&#8217;ll try to remember the new change it&#8217;s Organizing Inclusive and Diverse WordPress Events. And this is for WordCamp and meetup organizers to learn. We&#8217;ve learned over the last couple years, how important it is to create inclusive spaces and be good allies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do we actually do that? And a few of us created a very action oriented workshop in 2019 for WCUS, and that is now the basis of the work that we are bringing to people and people are loving it.. We&#8217;ve had people report a 40%, self-report 40%, increase in feeling prepared to create an inclusive event from before and after taking that workshop, which is super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, that’s my passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:12:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really love helping the WP Diversity team. I love running the workshops. I love running the workshops for myself, because I used to do training for software back before the pandemic. I used to train up to a thousand people a year in person, sometimes like 500 people in a room at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course I had to shift. I had to pivot to online training, which is what the training team has brought for me. And the focus on the diversity. I like running the workshops. I like running workshops for different groups, different countries, because it&#8217;s nice to meet new people. It&#8217;s nice to hear about their culture, about the limitations that people have in Africa with connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they, they resort to using WhatsApp on their phone in order to do a meetup. That&#8217;s how they do their, their meetings, their discussions. It&#8217;s unlike other countries where we can do video calls. They have to use their mobile phones because connectivity isn&#8217;t accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Places like in the Philippines that get affected when it starts to rain a little bit, we lose our internet. So we have backups and our backups have backups. So there are many things that you learn that are different when you&#8217;re living in the city, when you&#8217;re living in the provinces, in the country. So it&#8217;s so many things that you learn about people and how they&#8217;re able to adapt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:13:35]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enabling end users to reach their goals. And whether that means participating in contributing to the software, to the Core software itself, in terms of UI/UX usability. That can include participating in the community and sharing your knowledge proactively with users who may be new to the platform, or have used WordPress for a while, but now want to step up their game, get a little deeper into using their websites as a tool for growth, for whatever business that they&#8217;re in. So, I mean, overall, the, the most important part of the WordPress world to me are the end users. And, you know, there, there is this quote unquote inner circle of WordPress community people. People who are involved in .org, people who contribute to the software, people who contribute to the 20 plus make.wordpress.org teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those we have to keep in mind, are not the average user by and far. They are not the typical user that hears the word WordPress and then goes out and searches it and then has to figure out how to use it. So I think user experience is probably the most important part for me and making sure that any of that innate knowledge that we have in that inner circle of WordPress because many of us have been using it for so long, keeping in mind that is not the norm. And it&#8217;s not the scale at which WordPress is used and, and making sure we translate complex concepts down to a layperson&#8217;s terms that might not be as familiar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I have always found so fascinating about the web and WordPress’ role in it is how it has made the world simultaneously smaller and bigger. By giving voices to the voiceless we help each other find our community niches regardless of where they are in the world. Some of your closest friends could be people you would never meet in your own neighborhood. Well, let’s hear what some of our community members had to say about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Tea 00:15:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the thing that has been most empowering is, is coming into the project either in terms of contributing time and efforts to the community, which is where most of my contribution has been &#8211; has always been about this is a really cool thing, and I really want to build this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ll put my time and efforts into building WordPress. Not for me, but because I see its value and I see its community and I see that the contribution that it&#8217;s making to the world and I, and that&#8217;s really important. But finding that on the other side of that was a huge amount of personal benefit for me in my career, in the friendships that I&#8217;ve made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I feel like if I had been approaching the community with, I want a better career, I wanna meet all of these people and I want, and I want all of this. From, “I want” for me, instead of, I want for this project, for the community and effectively for the world with that, you know, that whole democratized, the democratizing of publishing is this thing that serves the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s been the key for me is that I absolutely have reaped amazing benefits from it, but it came out of that sense of, I see this value here and I want to contribute to that because it&#8217;s gonna have value, not just for me, but for a whole slew of people. And so, uh, you know, for much, much bigger impact than just on me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that&#8217;s the important thing for me is that sense of, if you approach it with that attitude of what can I do to help? It&#8217;s amazing what you will find yourself helped with in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:17:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that you enjoyed this tour of WordPress in the World Wide Web. I want to share a big thank you to all of the folks who contributed to our little WordPress Briefing celebration of World Wide Web Day today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. So firstly, we&#8217;ve got a couple of updates from our upcoming flagship events. WordCamp US has announced a speaker support fund specifically for historically underrepresented speakers at the event. You can donate to the fund on the page if you&#8217;d like, and there are also directions on how to request support, if you are part of an underrepresented group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the folks over at WordCamp Asia, the call for speakers is live. That&#8217;s taking place in February, 2023. But it&#8217;s never too early to brush up those presentations and get them submitted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next big thing is that there are some changes coming to the WordPress mobile app. A lot of the Jetpack functionality will be removed from it, so this is going to have a little bit of an effect on daily users of the app, but it will also have an effect on regular contributors. I&#8217;ll have a link to the full write up in the show notes so that you don&#8217;t have to guess or hold it all in your memory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, this excellent design that you see on wordpress.org/news is finally making its way out to the next parts of the wordpress.org website. Before you know, it, there will be a fresh looking homepage as well as few other pages and then… to infinity and beyond (or something like that).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And next up I&#8217;ll be taking just a mid-year break from the podcast. And so the next time that I actually see you again, will be in September.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13198\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"People of WordPress: Carla Doria\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/people-of-wordpress-carla-doria/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 19:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13201\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:324:\"In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better.

This month we feature Carla Doria, a customer support specialist from South America on how WordPress opened up a new world for her, and gave her the ability to help the local community</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Carla, working with WordPress is a vital part of her life. It gave her a career and a community, in which she she would organize the first WordCamp in her city, Cochabamba, and the first in Bolivia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla studied industrial engineering and has a master’s degree in environmental studies.<br>Her first experience with WordPress was when she decided to start a small business designing and selling cushions and bedclothes.&nbsp;While Carla sat in the small store she had rented, hoping that people stopping at the shop windows would step in to buy something, she decided she needed to create a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>First steps with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla had no budget to hire somebody, but she felt confident&nbsp; she could learn things on her own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Learning to use WordPress requires no code skills or a technical background. It needs an adventurous and playful spirit.” </p><cite>Carla Doria</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She had always been studious, and decided she would figure out how to build a website herself. Carla ended up building a simple blog with WordPress. At the time, she didn’t even have a budget to buy a custom domain, so she used a free subdomain.<br><br>“Learning to use WordPress is easy. It requires no code skills or a technical background at all. It only needs an adventurous and playful spirit,” said Carla</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were no profits, and any income mainly went to pay the store’s rent. At the time, her previous company contacted her for a job opening that matched her profile. Carla needed that income and decided to closed the store and forget about being an entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in employee mode, Carla started her new job as a technical writer for a software development company. Since Carla had completed her master’s degree in the UK, she was proficient in English. Her close affinity for computers and technology made it easy for her to translate complex software jargon into simple tutorial steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Carla got more interested in technical writing and started to improve her writing skills. This reconnected her with her previous enthusiasm for writing, and she decided to channel that interest into a blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Diving deep</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating her blog helped her become more familiar with WordPress and building websites. In 2015, Carla blogged about writing, her thoughts, book reviews, and everything that came to mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through looking for answers to specific issues using her WordPress blog, Carla found the support forums a useful place to go. Soon she realized that she could also help answer other people’s questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13189\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla began checking the forums as a hobby. She liked that she was able to help people and learn more while doing so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of surfing social media during her work breaks, Carla focused on checking the WordPress forums. Through this she learnt about a support job in one of the global firms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt the job was made for her and was excited to support people in building their websites with WordPress. The role offered the possibility to work remotely and travel while still working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After three years as a technical writer, her career felt stuck. She was certain she did not want to return to any job related to industrial engineering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla did not get through the selection process the first time. But after nearly 18 months between three applications and learning HTML and CSS, Carla finally secured a support job in 2016. With this job, WordPress became her main source of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Leading a local WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the job, Carla learned about the WordPress communities around the world and WordCamps. But when somebody asked about the WordPress community where Carla lived, she didn’t know what to say. Was there a community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She discovered no local group existed, so she researched what was needed to setup a meetup. Carla discussed the idea with others, but hesitated as she thought it would require an expert WordPress developer to organize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after trying to gauge interest, Carla realized that the only way to find community members was to start a community. In 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Cochabamba-WordPress-Meetup/\">WordPress community in Cochabamba</a> was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"684\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=684%2C391&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The theme preview screen in the WordPress Cochabamba meeting on creating your website with blocks.\" class=\"wp-image-13236\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?w=684&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>WordPress meeting in Cochabamba explored creating your website with blocks</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The group has had ups and downs, probably similar to any other community. Although Cochabamba is not a big city, they had issues finding a location that was free and available to anyone who wanted to join. People came with different levels of knowledge, from people with&nbsp;vast experience with WordPress to people with no experience but who wanted to learn.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community grew during the pandemic, as meetups went online and people from other cities in Bolivia were able to attend. After restrictions were lifted, there was a lot of excitement amongst members to meet each other in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Giving back through speaking</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Carla reading a book under a tree\" class=\"wp-image-13191\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The community also helped Carla to develop a new skill in public speaking. She applied to be a speaker at WordCamp Mexico <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2019/\">2019</a> and <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2020/\">2020</a>, <a href=\"https://guayaquil.wordcamp.org/2019/\">WordCamp Guayaquil 2019</a>, and <a href=\"https://colombia.wordcamp.org/2020/\">WordCamp Colombia in 2020</a>. Her confidence grew while she enjoyed connecting with other communities and meeting people who were on similar pathways. Not all of them were developers, as she had presumed. Many, like her, started out as bloggers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"977\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=977%2C419&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Cochabamba\'s logo with blue and grey lettering and a hat\" class=\"wp-image-13228\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?w=977&amp;ssl=1 977w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=768%2C329&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, after three years, Carla applied to organize her first WordCamp in 2021 in <a href=\"https://cochabamba.wordcamp.org/2021/\">Cochabamba</a>. She had never imagined organizing any WordCamp, and through this having the experience to talk to sponsors and contact companies, and lead a group of people with different talents and backgrounds. Carla felt she had learnt so much from the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to WordPress, Carla found a job she enjoyed, was able to work remotely, and help build something in her community to help people learn skills and find career opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla feels grateful for all she has been able to do thanks to WordPress. She said: “WordPress has led me to find good jobs.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an open source software project and, like many other open source software projects, has an entire community of people who show up to help improve it however they can. Most of you probably use WordPress every day in some way. And I&#8217;m going to assume that since you listen to this podcast, you&#8217;re also interested in how this all works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I mention practically every episode is that WordPress works and continues to work because of generous contributions from people all around the world. I consider my work with WordPress to be my way of giving back for everything that this software enabled me and my family to do. But I once was a first-time contributor, and I remember what it felt like before I knew everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt like it moved at the speed of light and that I could never tell what to do now, let alone what to do next. And that everyone around me basically already knew everything. And if you are feeling that way right now, I encourage you to take a big deep breath [breathe] and let me help you get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:43]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a roadmap sort of person. So I&#8217;m going to start by sharing the stages I&#8217;ve observed for folks who are contributing to open source. That way, you can tell where you are right now, which spoiler alert is probably a bit further along than you realize. Then I&#8217;ll give you some questions you can ask yourself for each stage to figure out what is a good fit for you. Think of it as a guided exploration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, the five stages. So these are they:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Connecting</strong>. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first learning about the community. You know WordPress exists, but now you&#8217;ve just discovered that the community exists. That&#8217;s where you are.&nbsp;</li><li>The second phase is <strong>Understanding</strong>. It&#8217;s when you are researching the community, like, you know it exists, you think you want to give back, and so you&#8217;re trying to figure out where everything is.&nbsp;</li><li>The third phase is what I call <strong>Engaging</strong>. It&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first interacting, you&#8217;ve downloaded the CMS, you have figured out which team you think you&#8217;re interested in, and you&#8217;re headed to events or meetings or whatever.&nbsp;</li><li>The fourth stage is one that I refer to as <strong>Performing</strong>. And that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;re gonna volunteer and you&#8217;re gonna take some action. You&#8217;re going to like a contributor day or running a release or whatever. I think that&#8217;s probably not the first place you land, running a release is probably a lot, but, you know, coordinating work on the release or something like that.&nbsp;</li><li>And then phase five, which is the <strong>Leading</strong> phase. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re taking responsibility for things getting done.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:08]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get any further, there are four important things to remember about those stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to remember is that there is no set time between any of those stages. You can start in one and then three years later go to the next one, or you can start in one and go into the next stage tomorrow. The next thing to know is that each stage builds on the one before it. In my observation, anytime I have seen a contributor who feels like they&#8217;re really struggling, it&#8217;s because they skipped a stage in there, which really causes some trouble for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing to remember is that not everyone will make it through these stages, which is okay. The majority of the community stops at three. Most contributors stop at four. And that is perfectly fine. That is expected. That is normal and completely in line with what we expect from contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and the final thing to remember about that list of the phases is that very few people make it into that leadership stage. If we assume, like I do, that 1% of the people who are using WordPress also show up and contribute back to WordPress, then it&#8217;s kind of safe to assume also that about 1% of those people who have shown up to contribute to WordPress are moving into a space where they feel like they&#8217;re willing to take responsibility for making sure things get done in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:31]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we all collectively feel responsible for WordPress&#8217;s success, but in that leadership area, you&#8217;re kind of taking responsibility for 40% of the web or whatever&#8217;s going on there. And not a lot of people make it there, and that is completely fine, too. So that&#8217;s our basic terminology today. Those are the caveats that go with our basic terminology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most difficulties that arise for new contributors happen because a stage got skipped somewhere along the way. It&#8217;s almost never intentional, but from what I&#8217;ve observed, that&#8217;s what makes it really difficult to get started and what makes it difficult to keep going once you&#8217;ve kind of already gotten in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, all right. Big breath, folks with me again [breathe]. Alright, it&#8217;s guided exploration time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First phase, the connecting phase. Remember, this is where you&#8217;ve just learned the community exists, people are talking about it, you don&#8217;t know much more. The first step for you is asking yourself what it is you could do. Or if there&#8217;s a project out there that looks particularly interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:36]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can ask yourself questions, like, am I a writer? And if I am a writer, do I write technical or prose. The other thing you can ask is, am I a PHP developer, a JavaScript developer, Python, Go; which language am I writing in because I find it most beautiful. Another thing you can ask yourself is, am I a teacher or a mentor, or do I just generally like to be a mighty helper? And I like to make sure that things keep running.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;ve asked yourself those things, it&#8217;s on to phase two, the understanding phase. This is when you&#8217;re looking around at this new-to-you community to see what is happening where. So you take a look at the teams that are around, you think about whatever it was you said you were good at in the last question and you look at which teams might be a good fit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you said that you&#8217;re a good technical writer, then Docs probably is for you. Have you been training others to use WordPress for years? Then you might wanna look into Training. There are a lot of other things, obviously, like if you think you&#8217;re good at working with code PHP or JavaScript, you&#8217;re probably gonna end up in Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are particularly good at any of the other tech stacks that we have around in our Trac area or an Openverse, then that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll land over there. You have design options. Like if design is really your thing, we have a Design team, but we also have a Themes team. There are plenty of places that you can land depending on what it is that you feel like you are the best at and could really help the WordPress project. And so that&#8217;s your phase two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have gotten a good guess at a team, we&#8217;re gonna swing through to phase three, which is the engaging phase. This is the phase that is the scariest for most people, but it&#8217;s okay. I am here for you. I am here for you in this podcast. So you have figured out what you want to do in order to contribute, and you&#8217;ve got a sense for the team that looks right. There are two things that you do next.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:34]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is that you can go to a meeting. There are many kinds of meetings. There are team meetings, bug scrubs, and testing sessions, but they&#8217;re all in Slack, which means that you can attend one from anywhere. When they kick off, you wave, you introduce yourself, you let everybody know that you&#8217;re there and you&#8217;re observing. Folks will welcome you and just kind of give you some concept of what they&#8217;re working on. Easy as that. You&#8217;ve done your first time meeting attendance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good option is to keep an eye out for specific events. Some of those events happen online, like Global Translation Day. But also some of them happen in person like, Meetups or WordCamps. And there again, you show up, you wave, you introduce yourself, see if you can make a connection or two, let people know that you&#8217;re new and you&#8217;re just trying to figure out where you are and what you wanna do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve made it now, all the way to phase four, the performing phase, then give yourself a little pat on the back! Figuring out where you want to go and who your friendly faces are is the biggest challenge when you get started. So congratulations!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:37]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase four is the phase where you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re brave enough to volunteer &#8211; to do some contribution. You&#8217;re volunteering your time. That&#8217;s where you are now. So oddly enough, you start this phase by assigning yourself something, assigning yourself, a task. This seems counterintuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this feeling that you can&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re gonna do something. That you can&#8217;t just assign something to yourself and say that you&#8217;re gonna do it. But in open source projects, you always can. You find a task where you&#8217;re comfortable, and you just mention that you would like to give it a try while the team is having their weekly meeting. And it&#8217;s simple as that. And not big things either. Like organizing an event or maintaining a component, those are probably too big for your first time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m talking things like, &#8216;I will test that patch that you mentioned in the meeting.&#8217; Or &#8216;I will review the docs and make sure that they&#8217;re up to date with the most recent release.&#8217; Or &#8216;I can help run meetings for the next release.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you have phase five, where you just repeat phase four until you are leading something! And I don&#8217;t mean leading in the 1950s sort of way, where you have like a corner office and you&#8217;re ordering people around. I mean, in the warm, inviting millennial way where you&#8217;re leading by inspiring people to do something or you&#8217;re leading because you make sure that the meeting happens every single week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you&#8217;re leading because you added screenshots to tickets that needed testing and so you moved something forward in a way that was helpful. Easy peasy. You can go to your first contributor today or a WordPress Slack meeting and just be a contributor by the time you leave, right? You might feel like ‘easy as that isn&#8217;t quite the right set of words right there. And as a matter of fact, you might be thinking to yourself, this woman is just plain wrong. It could not possibly be that easy. And I agree. It really isn&#8217;t literally quote-unquote just that easy. Just like handing someone a notebook and a pen will not instantly make them an award-winning novelist, handing someone a wordpress.org profile and credentials to Slack won&#8217;t instantly make them a contributor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For both of those examples, what makes someone good is the ability to try and fail and still be encouraged to try again. So if it&#8217;s been a while since you contributed and you&#8217;re thinking about returning, or if you&#8217;ve been listening to me for a while and you&#8217;re ready to give this contribution thing a try, I hope this helps you to feel brave enough to try and brave enough to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I encourage you to be brave enough to try again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:20]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at our small list of big things. My friends, we have a Performance team. This team has been a working group for a long time and is focused on some deep, inner workings of WordPress and its surrounding ecosystem to make sure that we are as fast and slick as possible. You can check them out on make.wordpress.org/performance, their brand new site, and see when they&#8217;re meeting, what they&#8217;re aiming to get into the WordPress 6.1 release, and if that&#8217;s something that you would like to contribute to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that there&#8217;s a brand new call out for testing. This time it&#8217;s focused on templates and retroactively applying them to an entire category of posts. So it&#8217;s a little bit workflow testing, a little bit technology testing, and we could really use your help in bug hunting for both of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is that you know since contribution is obviously the focus of today&#8217;s podcast, we are looking for table leads for WordCamp US’ contributor day that&#8217;s coming up in September. There&#8217;s a whole blog post about it, I&#8217;ll link to it in the show notes so that you&#8217;ll have all the info and can raise your hand if you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:25]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of things that I&#8217;ll have in the show notes, I also am going to put like a contributor quizlet guide thing. If the guided, figuring out of the teams in the phase two section, if that didn&#8217;t make any sense to you and you just need something to direct you specifically to potential teams, I&#8217;m gonna link to the contributor kind of sorting hat quiz that came out with WordCamp Europe.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I&#8217;m talking about Five for the Future– again. Before we get stuck right into the heart of it, 10 episodes ago, in episode 25, I focused on the Five for the Future initiative and I recommend that you listen to that before you join me in today&#8217;s episode. It&#8217;s only eight minutes and it gives you a history of the Five for the Future initiative, as well as some information on the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It then goes on to talk about some of the original intentions behind that original initiative. The reason I bring this back up today is partially because one, I will talk about both the program and the initiative it&#8217;s based on literally anytime. I believe strongly that they are both a vital part of what will result in a triumph of the commons of WordPress, and keep this empowering project around for years to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also bring it up today because there&#8217;s conversation about a post I published a couple of months back that has generated some dialogue around the intentions of this catchy call to contribution. So to make sure that as we move through this discussion together, we are working with as much factual information as possible, I present to you some facts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, the pillars of this initiative. The 5% in Five for the Future is aspirational. Contribution to open source is a question and indication of privilege. So the 5% is not a requirement, but rather it&#8217;s an aim. It could refer to 5% of your time or 5% of your resources, or just any amount of your time or resources around. Regardless of how you&#8217;re defining it, it is an aspiration, not a requirement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second pillar, pledges show your intention and whatever contributions you are able to offer after you&#8217;ve made your pledge are always welcome. No one is out there checking for 100% completion of the hours that you intended to give back to WordPress versus the hours that you actually succeeded at giving back to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many volunteers that make sure that this project is running and functional and has plenty of people knowing how to get things done and how to teach others how to get things done. It&#8217;s all coming from generosity of heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:52]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of generosity, the third thing that is important about this initiative is that it insists on and wants to celebrate a culture of generosity. Beyond the concept of a pledge, is the idea of generous collaboration toward the long term health and stability of our project for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As contributors, we understand that we are greater than the sum of our parts and what we build <em>within</em> WordPress empowers those who build <em>with</em> WordPress. So those are the pillars that went into that initial thought, that opening Five for the Future call to action that Matt gave to everybody in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now I want to share with you some of the pillars of the program that has grown up around it. So the Five for the Future initiative, if you&#8217;re not familiar, was started in 2014 and is a grand call to all of us to remember to give back to the shared commons of WordPress. Its aim was to help guard against what is called the “tragedy of the commons,” where resources are continually taken out and not necessarily reinvested in. No one&#8217;s necessarily putting anything back into those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:06]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the starting point for all of this. So the program, the Five for the Future program, in 2018 was built as a collaborative effort with full participation and buy-in from the contributors who were active in the project at the time. It allowed anyone to raise their hands, to show support of WordPress via a pledge and also started a multi-year discussion of how to define contributions in a way that let us automatically provide props and therefore more effectively put badges on people&#8217;s wordpress.org profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in 2019, there was an additional pilot of the program, which kind of offered some team structure, which was intended to not only take on work that I don&#8217;t like to ask volunteers to do, but also to provide some checks and balances to an absolute raft of sponsored contributor hours that we had started to see show up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us then to the post that I mentioned at the start. Knowledgeable supporters of the WordPress open source project have debated next iterations to Five for the Future activity and programming. So, to bring the conversation to a central set of questions, or rather to bring the conversation to a central spot, I raised these two questions. One, what activities can we see inside our contributor networks? So wordpress.org, make.wordpress.org, the Rosetta sites that we have, Slack, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what activities can we see inside the contributor networks that we can flag to enable easier distribution of props and therefore badges? The second question is, what activities can we see also in those contributor networks that appear to be contributions, but in the end are only benefiting the person or company that provides the contributions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth that discussion then also raised a third question that I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve even started to tackle, which is what about the activities that are not in the contributor network, but still do move WordPress forward? Cause there are so, so many of those things and it&#8217;s a great question. I don&#8217;t have an answer and just so that I don&#8217;t leave you all with a series of questions for which there are no answers provided in this particular podcast, I do have a few answers for questions that I have seen floating around this discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first question is actually a bunch of questions. There are like three parts to it. What are props, who gives props, and who tracks them? So ‘props’ is a term used in WordPress to describe shared recognition of a contribution. Think of it as like a hat tip or kudos or an assist. However you think about it, it&#8217;s recognition of the other people who helped to solve a problem along the way. That is what props are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:47]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that question is who gives props and historically developers have given props, which tends to mean that it&#8217;s mostly developers who get props. But now, also, any team rep during a release cycle can provide props to folks on their team, volunteers on their team who were really helpful during the course of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And recently we also added the functionality for ad hoc props to be given in the Slack props channel, and those get added to your profile activity. So that someone can give you basically a public thanks for having helped on something that they were working on. And then that gets logged in your activity tracker on your WordPress.org profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final question in that first big question is who tracks these props? And the answer is human beings! Which is why folks feel like they have to do a ton of things before they even get props. And that&#8217;s also why I&#8217;d like to automate more and more of them so that you don&#8217;t have to do a ton of things in order for someone to show up and acknowledge that you are part of a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:51]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the second question that I&#8217;ve seen kind of running around is, where do props start? And that is a great question that has been asked year after year. And one that I think we should continue to ask. The reality is that we won&#8217;t be able to see every contribution to WordPress, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they aren&#8217;t valuable. And it doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t matter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building our culture of generosity helps us to better recognize and celebrate each other for all of our contributions, whether they are for a major release or a major event, or one of these new ad hoc props that you can offer to people. And if we see more and more of the same type of contributions being celebrated, then we can also work toward automating those as well, so that you don&#8217;t have to do a super ton of them before someone has noticed that you&#8217;ve done even one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third big question that has been running around is, what about the people who don&#8217;t want the props? If people want to be literally anonymous, then deletion requests are probably your way to go. But I actually don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the question here. I think the question is what if a prop holds no intrinsic value to you and then, you know, I wanna thank you for that spirit of generosity. And I also wanna say that I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:02]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, all of these answers clarify what lies at the heart of what is intended with the Five for the Future initiative and the program that&#8217;s built on top of it. And why I care so much about fixing the ways we offer props to folks. For me, it&#8217;s not about assessing the worthiness of people or companies or any of their contributions. For me, it&#8217;s about reinvesting in the shared commons of the WordPress ecosystem, by finding a way that our economy can entice folks to put back into WordPress, something close to the benefit that they receive from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Thank you all for making it into the final stretches with me. These three things that I&#8217;m sharing also have companion blog posts to go with them because they are very big questions or very big features, very big plugin kind of things that we&#8217;re looking at. And so you&#8217;ll be able to find those in the show notes, or you can go to wordpress.org/news if you&#8217;re listening to this in a podcast player of your choice that is not wordpress.org.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one on my list is a new plugin. It is called Create Block Theme. And it&#8217;s gonna make it easier for theme builders to use the existing site editor tools to create new block themes. I&#8217;m very excited about this. Uh, you can find it on make.wordpress.org/themes. And I will also include a link to it in the show notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If themes are not your area of expertise, but you are interested in documentation or the DevHub or to an extent design things, then the improvements that are being worked on for the DevHub are definitely in your area. That&#8217;s kind of a Meta task, but has a few other pieces involved as well. That can be found on make.wordpress.org/meta. But again, I will have a link to the very, very detailed blog post in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s got a bunch of hypothetical changes that are being suggested for the WordPress developer docs, uh, especially when it comes to the function reference. And so there are gonna be some slight design questions, but not like, graphic design/visual design, more in the like, can humans read this design area of things? And so that will be a good one to look at. If you are sort of in the Meta or Documentation vein of things in the way that you like to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:011:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing is about open sourcing theme designs. So open sourcing everything obviously is important to us. And the design tool that we use, this tool called Figma, is open to the public. And so it&#8217;s possible for folks to be able to kind of get in there and use and reuse any design elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s a discussion happening over on make.wordpress.org/design about how that can and should look in the future. And so if design is definitely your area, and again, this kind of lines up with themes a little bit, then wander over into that one, for which there will also be a link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13132\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"The Month in WordPress – June 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Jul 2022 14:19:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13069\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:313:\"With WordPress 6.1 already in the works, a lot of updates happened during June.

The potential and power of blogs would be an influence in the rest of his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo sat in front of a pond. \" class=\"wp-image-13027\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As Leo&#8217;s confidence grew through expressing himself in writing, he was determined that his stutter would &#8216;no longer hold power over him&#8217;. In 2005, with the encouragement of his blog readers, he spent his school summer break in his room working on reducing his stutter. WordPress would be the tool that would enable him to connect with his blog readers and to express his creativity and thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making WordPress your own</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In high school, Leo had opted for programming as one of his subjects. In 2008, he built his first website using WordPress for the students at the school. This was the first time he saw the real value of WordPress and open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the following years, he increasingly spent time searching online for information on &#8216;Customising WordPress&#8217; and &#8216;Making WordPress your own&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo wanted to keep busy and as soon as he finished school, he applied for every entry-level web-related job that he could find. He was hired by a company for the role of webmaster for its Marketing team focused on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He continued to grow his skills as a WordPress developer with the help of useful documentation that he could find and through his helpful local WordPress Community. This helped him earn a living and support his family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping yourself through helping others in the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, Leo moved full-time to Cape Town, South Africa, and started as a developer at a web development agency, eventually progressing to its Head of Development and managing a small team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He chose WordPress as his main platform for development mainly because of the community behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Had it not been for those searches on how to make WordPress your own, my life would have turned out a lot differently</em>.”&nbsp;</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo felt he had a hurdle to overcome working in web sector. He didn’t feel like a ‘real developer’ being self-taught. However, through the community, he realized that there were many self-taught developers and he was not alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside his development path, Leo faced a mental health journey. He had suffered from depression and found the community to be accepting and understanding of this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Cape Town 2016, he stood in front of an audience and gave a talk: “<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/11/24/leo-gopal-the-wordpress-community-mental-wellness-and-you/\">The WordPress Community, Mental Wellness, and You</a>”. Following this talk, he was greeted by many attendees who thanked him for talking so openly about mental health issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at the podium at WordCamp Cape Town in 2016\" class=\"wp-image-13023\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2016</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has been diagnosed with bipolar, previously known as manic depression. In 2017, he hit a low period and struggled to keep going. He found support and understanding in the community in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has openly written about his experiences with depression and started an initiative where topics of mental health and general wellbeing can be freely and non-judgmentally discussed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that by helping others, he is helping himself, every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has contributed to the community as a Co-organizer in South Africa for the 2016 and 2017 WordCamp Cape Town, WordPress Meetup Cape Town 2015 &#8211; 2016, and WordPress Durban 2017 – 2020. He has also spoken at a number of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining connections with people he had met through these events Leo felt was a great aid to his mental wellbeing during the Covid pandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has contributed to core and plugins and believes that WordPress and its community make it extremely easy to contribute. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>The cost to start contributing is extremely low &#8211; start now</em>”.</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When the ability to create and add patterns to the WordPress.org library came out in 2021, Leo used it almost immediately and created a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/call-to-action-section-2/\">call-to-action box</a> which could be used by both his clients and the community. He plans to release a few more complex patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Yes, we can.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo’s mantra is “I can do it!”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at a WordCamp Cape Town in 2019\" class=\"wp-image-13032\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?w=1944&amp;ssl=1 1944w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting over a stutter, overcoming poverty, being urgently self-taught, growing up in a country with “load shedding” electricity outages, and one of the slowest rated internet speeds in the developing world, and strengthening mental wellness are not easy feats., And yet, he knows he can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Never, ever think you do not have the &#8216;right&#8217; circumstances for success.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right my friends. So it&#8217;s been about a month since WordPress 6.0 came out and you know what that means. It means we are already looking at the next major WordPress release because,&nbsp; as most of you know, WordPress never sleeps. Y&#8217;all are honestly up and hustling like 24/7 as far as I can tell, which is great! And is one of the many benefits of being a global community, I suppose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, back to this major release. There was a high-level roadmap shared by Mattias Ventura at the start of June. And it lists some focus areas for the Block Editor, continued refinements to the template editor and navigation block, and some work on global styles and more / better blocks and design tools that are slated to ship with WordPress 6.1. From the WordPress core side, though, there are a couple hundred tickets that are milestoned for the next major.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being milestoned for a release means that either a ticket wasn&#8217;t ready for the last release and was moved to the next available one, or a ticket has become ready for a release since the last major release occurred. That list as it stands might be a little bit too big for a single release. However, honestly, no list is too big if we have enough folks contributing.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;ve never contributed to a major release of WordPress before, and you&#8217;re interested to know how that works, there are some things to keep an eye out for over the next few weeks. We are in what is considered the planning phase for the next big release. And so there are two or three things you&#8217;re gonna see pretty soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First is a planning kickoff post. That post gets published on make.wordpress.org/core, and it includes notes on volunteering for the release squad, some guesses at areas of focus based on the tickets that we&#8217;re seeing in track, a schedule, the whole kit, and caboodle. It&#8217;s all in there. If you are wanting to know how to lend a hand and how to take your first steps to core contribution, apart from the new contributor meeting that happens before the dev chat, that post is the place to start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So keep an eye out on make.wordpress.org/core for that. And then the second thing that shows up in the planning phase for any major release is bug scrub and ticket triage meetings. Like I mentioned, there are the new contributor meetings where they scrub tickets and talk through the basics of what we&#8217;re seeing on good first bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mentioned that here often, I just mentioned it in the last, in the last bullet point, but there are also regular bug scrubs and ticket triaging sessions where a kind contributor chooses a set of tickets to review and then leads other contributors through the process of checking to see if a ticket is valid to see if it can be replicated to see if it has a patch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are decisions that are blocking it and how to move those decisions forward, and generally just kind of discuss what else has to be done in order to take the ticket to the next step. Those get announced in the dev chat every Wednesday, but also there is a post that will go up on make.wordpress.org/core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I had a faster way to say that instead of just racing through the whole URL every time. But it&#8217;ll be okay. We&#8217;ll put it in the show notes in case you would rather just click some stuff. And the third thing to keep an eye out for. If development is not your thing, so writing code is not already part of your tool belt, that&#8217;s totally fine. There are many other important areas where you can contribute, too. Design, training, support, polyglots, marketing, documentation, and more. These teams all do work in and around a release that is vital to WordPress&#8217; overall success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:19]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a final thought of all. If that felt a little too intense if you want to see where this ship is headed, but you can&#8217;t quite commit to grabbing an oar today, that&#8217;s fine, too. The most important thing is that if you are a member of the community, as an extender or a user or a die-hard contributor, or a new contributor, the most important thing is that you have some general awareness of what the overall direction is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might do that by experimenting with blocks in your products or by testing screen readers against your workflow or even by setting aside an hour to participate in the latest testing prompt. Being aware of what&#8217;s happening in and around your area of the project will help to keep you kind of prepared and knowledgeable to lend a hand whenever it is that you are ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:14]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that then brings us to our small list of big things. My friends, registration is now open for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India. That&#8217;s taking place on September 24th and 25th. Uh, it&#8217;s happening over Zoom, so location or travel shouldn&#8217;t really be an obstacle for you. I&#8217;m going to leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. It should be an excellent opportunity that [the] WP Diversity initiative that WordPress has, that the community team helps to foster, is really an excellent experience. And so I hope that you register and attend that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second thing actually is a bit of a celebration. The Photo Directory recently hit a huge milestone of 3000 photos! And you also can submit your photos to wordpress.org/photos. If you feel so inclined to make a contribution of that type.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:06:07]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing on my smallest of big things is actually kind of a, a WordPress tooltip a little bit of a WordPress project did-ya-know? So, there is a special channel in WordPress Slack for sharing thanks to folks who were especially helpful to you. It&#8217;s called the Props Channel. And when someone shares props with you, it even shows up in your activity on your wordpress.org profile. Pretty cool, huh? Props to the Meta team for that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13013\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WP Briefing: Episode 33: Some Important Questions from WCEU\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/06/episode-33-some-important-questions-from-wceu/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 11:01:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"wp-briefing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=13005\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:165:\"WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy covers some important questions from WordCamp Europe on this special episode of the WordPress Briefing podcast. \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:9:\"enclosure\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:3:\"url\";s:60:\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/WP-Briefing-033.mp3\";s:6:\"length\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"type\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13788:\"\n<p>In the thirty-third episode of the WordPress Briefing, hear Josepha Haden Chomphosy recap important questions from WordCamp Europe, and a selection of Contributor Day interviews. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

It&#8217;s a big part of our business. And I think it&#8217;s like WordPress is a big part of all the hosting company, company’s, businesses, you know? So for us, it is like, we want to make it better. We want to give back. We want to understand, you know, where we can contribute the most. And we see it as a, you know, win, win, win situation for everyone, for clients, for the whole ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for us as a business, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Milana Cap </strong>00:00:32]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite WordPress component is WP CLI. That&#8217;s my crush, haha, because I love terminal. I love doing it. I&#8217;m not a really UI type of person, I get lost in UI. But in terminal, you just type command and it does what you want. And a WP CLI is much more powerful than WordPress dashboard. You can do so many things there and you can have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so that&#8217;s my go-to tool!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. And welcome to the WordPress Briefing– the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:36]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many people were at WordCamp Europe a couple of weeks ago. And at the end, Matt and I closed out the event sessions with a little question and answer time from the community. I was excited to see everyone and excited to answer their questions. But as with all spur of the moment answers, I experienced this <em>l&#8217;esprit de l&#8217;escalier </em>and I found that there were a few things that I would have answered a little more completely if I had taken more than two seconds to think about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I&#8217;m going to augment some of the answers from that session with a little more context and clarity. There was a question from Laura Byrne about favorite blocks in recent WordPress releases. And given that I was exclusively holding WordCamp Europe information in my brain at the time, I couldn&#8217;t think of which block was my favorite. While I was sitting there on that stage,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized that one of my favorite things about WordPress’s 6.0 release, like Matt, wasn&#8217;t really a block, but it was a functional workflow sort of thing. So my favorite thing was the ability to lock blocks, but I mean, the question was about favorite blocks. And so I do know that some of the most anticipated blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks. Whew. What a sentence!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:46]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to say that three times fast! Those blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks, they are sort of shortcuts that show up when you&#8217;re selecting multiple blocks and allow for easy side-by-side layouts. I&#8217;m not explaining it in a way that does it much justice, but I will share a link in the show notes that has more information and you can kind of see how empowering that particular block is in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question I wanted to give a little more context to came from Courtney Robertson. She asked about how to make translated content more readily available on learn.wordpress.org. My answer was pretty far ranging and talked about why it&#8217;s harder to commit to prioritizing that over, for my example, translating WordPress core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also understand that there are people who want to help and just need someone to point them in the right direction. And so I want to be clear that it is possible to have workshops in any language on learn.wordpress.org right now. We just don&#8217;t have a lot of people contributing those translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are conversations going on right now in the training team about using Glotpress on learn.wordpress.org, and also how to translate subtitles. So, if you are looking for ways to give back through translation and training is an important kind of area of your focus. I will have links to both of those things in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:11]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gave a quick answer, uh, after this question about how hard it is to recognize contributions that are separate from a major event or major release. In this case, when I say recognize, that&#8217;s recognized as in thank, not recognize as in, know it exists. In case it&#8217;s not clear why that was connected, why that answer was connected to the question, training materials are self-serve and not always specific to individual releases of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that means the maintenance of any content around training happens routinely over the course of time, rather than because of a specific release or a WordCamp. What sometimes can make it a little harder to entice people to join us in that work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now the third question I&#8217;d like to tackle is the one that came from Megan Rose. She asked how we can encourage better diversity as we go back to in-person events. My answer was more about the big picture, program-wide work that has been done and specific awarenesses that I, as a leader, have been keeping top of mind. That answer is still true and is still important, but again, it doesn&#8217;t really help anyone who&#8217;s wondering how they can show up today in their own communities, and do the hard work of fostering an inclusive space there so that we can confidently welcome more diverse voices together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great place to start is to have conversations with people who aren&#8217;t like you and really listen. Also recognizing that we all come from different backgrounds that give us more or less opportunity and always be asking yourself, who is missing from this conversation and why, how can I find them and invite them into our own WordPress spaces?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that all kind of feels right up your alley, I would check out the show notes. I&#8217;ll have some links in there to the community team’s site, as well as a few posts that will help you to explore that a bit further as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also a couple of questions about market share slash usage of WordPress, and Five for the Future that I really do want to answer, but as I was writing up the context and just kind of exploring the questions that people were raising, it turned out to really be quite a big set of answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will do those in either two separate episodes of their own or one surprisingly long, for me, episode. And so there you have it, a lightning round, deep dive on a few questions from WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Jonathan Desrosiers </strong>00:06:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely great to be back in person. Um, it&#8217;s been a long two years, two or three years for a lot of people and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s great that we&#8217;re such an asynchronous community and we can all stay connected online through Slack and different means. Um, but there are some things that you can&#8217;t replace, like making friends with people and learning people&#8217;s demeanors and having some discussions in person that you can&#8217;t replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, uh, I&#8217;m really excited to see people I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. Meet new people and, um, you know, have some of those discussions here today in Portugal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:07:21]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which then brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you missed the announcement, WordCamp Europe will be in Athens next year. And the call for organizers is open already. It&#8217;s an experience that is absolutely irreplaceable. So I&#8217;ll link to that in the show notes, in case you&#8217;ve always wanted to give back to WordPress that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my list is that work on the next major release of WordPress is already underway. There is a post with roadmap info that was published recently, as well as a slightly more casual thread on Twitter. I&#8217;ve linked both of those in the show notes, so that you have some concept of what it is that we are aiming for in 6.1, and also a concept of where to go to get started working on it if that&#8217;s what you feel like doing, uh, for the next three to four months– 120 days, roughly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and finally. This is less of like a thing to be aware of in the next two weeks and kind of a little WordPress project tool tip. Did you know that we have a calendar that shows all meetings for all teams all week long? It will make you feel tired by the amount of work that gets done in the WordPress project every week, but it&#8217;s right there on make.wordpress.org/meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you never have to wonder where folks are meeting to talk about things ever again. And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Santana Inniss &amp; Héctor Prieto </strong>00:09:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello!

She recalls: “No one thought to say, ‘Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…’. I mean, I was a girl (and I was told girls didn’t ‘do’ computers). No one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no particular career path into technology, Dee was encouraged in her final year of school to apply for a job in a bank where she worked and became a teller three years later. She gained financial independence, which enabled her to travel as a 20-year-old and spend the next three years exploring the US and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, she noted how the world had changed: the first computer mouse she had seen had come out in 1983, and 20 years later WordPress was founded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Journey into coding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During those 20 years, Dee worked as a nanny, working in child care centers, in customer support, and as a temp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1999, she packed up her bags once again, and moved from New Zealand to Australia. She took a place at a performing arts school where she honed her singing and performance skills and volunteered her time to the music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And so my personal revolution began. On the day after I graduated from that course, I walked into a full-time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of that job, Dee edited and sent HTML newsletters on a weekly basis. This ignited her interest in programming, and she bought books about coding for the web and experimented on her home-built PC making web pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“I’m sure, like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser. From there, I was completely hooked.”</p>\n<cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Later she moved to the IT department and took on maintenance of all the websites. By 2004, she was working full-time as a webmaster. A year later, she was running a small business creating sites on the side. Four years after that, her business became her full-time job as she left employment to pursue her Masters Degree in Digital Communication and Culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee with other contributors getting things ready for a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-12961\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dee and other volunteers setting up for a local WordCamp</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee found the theory and sociology behind the web, and its facilitation of human and machine communication fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I love the fact that the tech industry involves a constant constant curve of growth and discovery, which results in a perpetual exercise in finding creative elegant solutions for sticky problems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Dee, being able to use her innate curiosity to leverage processes, people, and tools, fuelled by a focus on communicating a message, has been a defining inspiration in her work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combined fascination coincided with her meeting WordPress in 2009 and subsequently its community. She moved her existing blog to the software and it became the CMS of choice for all her client work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The WordPress community can change your world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, she stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. Dee has reflected publicly that WordPress didn’t change her life, its community changed her world!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She flew on a whim from her then home in Sydney to attend a WordCamp in Melbourne she had found after a search for ‘WordPress Conferences’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back home excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WordPress community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a community locally around WordPress got off to a slow start in Sydney. From an inauspicious early WordPress Sydney meetup in the function room of a pub, her connection and involvement took off. Before long she was helping organize that meetup, and by the time she moved away from that great city it had branched into two meetups, and soon after, into three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was so inspired by the community that at the end of that first year and her second WordCamp, she raised her hand to help organize a WordCamp Sydney in 2012, and after moving interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee said: “WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now). The thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it. WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee pictured second from left as part of the WordPress 5.6 contributors\" class=\"wp-image-12957\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=768%2C246&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Some of the contributors to the <em>WordPress 5.6 release</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee was a coordinator for WordPress 5.6 release in 2020 and was able to encourage others to learn about the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping others and sharing knowledge through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee has been an advocate for cross-cultural collaboration and understanding in both WordPress and her work for a large distributed agency which has people from more than 24 countries and operates across 16 timezones.

It’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee’s career in WordPress has moved through coding, into project management of large scale WordPress projects, and now into delivery leadership. Her connections to community have helped &#8216;fuel the transitions&#8217; through these chapters of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels that she is ‘living proof’ that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, you can be helped, resourced and connected into places you had never thought possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has enabled her to reach and have a career in technology that she did not know existed as a teenager playing with that first computer mouse and experimenting with code. Dee hopes her story will inspire others in their journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>) for work on this feature.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it. As well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the approach of various mid-year breaks and the prospect of wandering off for some safe, restorative travel, I&#8217;ve been updating my to-read and re-read list. As I was looking at the queued books for my Northern hemisphere summer, there were some common threads, mostly around leadership, but there&#8217;s also like a chunk that&#8217;s about cross-cultural group theory and economics, and then like some beach reads, but there&#8217;s one group in particular that you all might find interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a group that&#8217;s sort of like a back-to-FOSS basics list. So I&#8217;ll share my top few with you in case you want to pack a copy for your next getaway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one on our list is called Producing Open Source Software by Karl Fogel. I think everyone who contributes to FOSS projects has received this as one of their first recommendations. Like, y&#8217;all are building open software? Excellent, you need to read Producing Open Source Software. Like, that is just a sentence that comes out of everyone&#8217;s mouths. So this was one of the first open source books that was recommended to me when I joined the WordPress community. It was freshly revised in 2020, and I haven&#8217;t given it a read since then, which is why it is on my reread list this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it shaped the early days of the WordPress project’s leadership, and their lead developers, and some of WordPress&#8217;s basic philosophies. It&#8217;s all available online, under a creative commons, ShareAlike license. And so it&#8217;s worth the read. I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so it&#8217;s easy for everyone to find in the event that is your preferred beach read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one on this list is a book from Nadia Eghbal. She wrote the excellent Roads and Bridges report that also is probably not light beach reading, but you know, this one is on my list to read this summer because Eghbal always delivers truths about the reality of maintaining popular software, popular, open source software, in a way that&#8217;s easy for me to access and process rather than getting paralyzed by the enormity of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth your mileage may vary on that. I realized that, like, I live and breathe open source stuff. And so just because I am not paralyzed by the enormity of her explanations of things doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you will have a similar experience. And so I&#8217;m just going to claim that elephant in the room for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you only read one book on this list this year, I think that this should be the one that you read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third one is called Code: Collaborative Ownership and the Digital Economy. It was edited by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh. I am certain that I butchered that name. And so I apologize on my own behalf to everyone that knows whether or not I said it correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book focuses on intellectual property rights and the original purpose of having anything like copyright in the world. So, right up my alley! The writers who contributed to this work promise exploration of the plight of creativity in the commons, the role of sharing in creative advancement, and a concept of what it would look like if intellectual property were to mean the second closing of an ecosystem versus a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, obviously, this one is very light reading. You can take this topic to high tea and everyone will not know what you&#8217;re talking about. However, this one looks like a really interesting book to me and I am just super ready to read it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second to last one on the list is a book called Humble Inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new-to-me book that seems right in line with one of my favorite books to recommend to leaders in the open source space. From reviews of it, I have gathered that it takes a hard look at the value of listening and asking for clarification in a world that puts a high value on an unsolicited hot take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It puts the importance of high trust relationship building, which is at the heart of any cross-culturally aware organization. And for folks who&#8217;ve been working with me for a while, you know, that relationship building is an important part of my leadership expectations for myself. So it puts relationship building at the front and center with a promise of practical applications for everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you ever have tried to tackle a complicated topic like this, you know that practical applications are really hard to come by and it&#8217;s often hard to understand it if you don&#8217;t have those practical applications. And so that is why this one is on my read and reread list this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:24]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally the WordPress Milestones book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this sounds like a shameless plug for WordPress. And on the one hand, this whole podcast is about WordPress. And so, yes! But on the other hand, I actually am reading this for two specific reasons. I&#8217;m rereading this actually. I read it when I first joined Automattic. And so the first of the two reasons that I&#8217;m rereading it this year is that volume two of this is, like the second decade of WordPress currently, being researched and written in preparation for WordPress’s 20th birthday next year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am rereading this to kind of get that all back in my mind as that work is getting done. And the second reason is that I honestly like to remind myself of how far we&#8217;ve come sometimes. I talk about our work frequently. And I talk about what we&#8217;re working on right now, all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about what we&#8217;re looking at three years from now, five years from now. The biggest concerns of today, tomorrow, and the future-future. And it&#8217;s very easy to forget how much success WordPress has had and how much growth the contributors that support us have had over the course of our long and storied history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I like to go back to that just to kind of give myself some grounding in our progress, as well as get some concept for how we can move forward together. So that one is also available online. Also under a creative commons ShareAlike license and it is also worth the read. I will share a link to that with the other one in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. Let&#8217;s see what we got in the old lineup today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, firstly WordCamp Europe is happening this week and it&#8217;s possible to watch the live stream from the comfort of your own home. There are some smart and talented speakers at the event. So I encourage you to catch a few if you have the time. I&#8217;ll include a link to the live stream information in the show notes below, and then also you can always keep an eye out on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot of discussions, a lot of conversation there. And so you can engage with folks that are there at the time and catch up on those conversations, catch up on those presentations in your own time, as it fits into your day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordPress’s community team is preparing the annual meetup survey right now. So if you participate in meetup events, keep an eye out for that because your feedback helps us to make plans to improve that program so that it works better for you. And it helps you to learn WordPress better and feel more confident with what you are taking out into the world that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you are wanting to use this as a chance to contribute, we actually will need folks who are able to translate the surveys as well. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. If all of that stuff about contribution didn&#8217;t make any sense, then just like keep an eye out from your meetup organizer and they will make sure that you have that survey so that you can have your voice heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then item three is less of an item. I mean, it&#8217;s an item cause it&#8217;s in this list, but it&#8217;s less of, like, a thing to know and more of a general thing to be aware of. It&#8217;s a general awareness item. There&#8217;s a lot going on in WordPress right now. I can see how hard it is to keep track of some of these things these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know as someone who&#8217;s looking at this all day every day that, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot. And it&#8217;s hard to get your bearings. So if you have a team that you contribute to already, don&#8217;t forget to reach out to each other, just to check-in. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to ask for help. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to offer help and you know, if no one needs any help from you at that moment, a little hello also can brighten someone&#8217;s day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"WordPress 6.0 “Arturo”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/arturo/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 May 2022 20:01:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12879\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:278:\"Say hello to “Arturo” and WordPress 6.0, inspired by Grammy-winning jazz musician, Arturo O’Farrill.

With thoughtful updates to the writing experience, building better block functionality, and adding a new intuitive style switcher, I’m really proud of the work that’s been done in this release to make a great site editing experience.</p><cite>Josepha Haden Chomphosy, Executive Director</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0.zip\">Download WordPress 6.0</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s Inside</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting multiple lines of text from two blocks\" class=\"wp-image-12887\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enhanced Writing Experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing improvements abound, whether you’re writing a brand new post or adding elements to an existing page. Explore more ways to streamline your content creation process, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Select text across multiple blocks for easier copying and pasting.</li><li>Type two open brackets `<code>[[</code>` to quickly access a list of recent posts and pages.</li><li>Keep existing styles when you transform some blocks from one kind to another—from a Paragraph block to a Code block, for instance.</li><li>Create customized buttons and any new buttons you make will retain the style customizations automatically.</li><li>Make tag clouds and social icons even more appealing with updated settings and controls, and a new outline style for the tag cloud.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Style-switcher-big.gif?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Style variations of Twenty Twenty Two theme\" class=\"wp-image-12893\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Style Switching&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Block themes now include the option to contain multiple style variations. This expands the new Style system even further and enables shortcuts to switch the look and feel of your site all within a single theme. In block themes that support this feature, you can change both the available settings, like the font-weight, and the style options, like the default color palette. Change the look and feel of your site with just a few clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Popover listing available templates\" class=\"wp-image-12889\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Template Choices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 includes five new template options for block themes: author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy. These additional templates provide greater flexibility for content creators. Tailor each with the tools you already know or with the following new options in this release:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Featured images can be used in the cover block.</li><li>New featured image sizing controls make it easier to get the results you want.</li><li>While editing a template, at the root, or between blocks, the quick inserter shows you patterns and template parts to help you work faster and discover new layout options.</li><li>The query block supports filtering on multiple authors, support for custom taxonomies, and support for customizing what is shown when there are no results.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Browsing footer patterns in the quick inserter\" class=\"wp-image-12890\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Integrated Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns will now appear when you need them in even more places, like in the quick inserter or when creating a new header or footer. If you’re a block theme author, you can even <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns/\">register patterns from the Pattern Directory using `<code>theme.json</code>`</a>, enabling you to prioritize specific patterns that are most helpful to your theme’s users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional Design Tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Design tools grow more powerful and intuitive with each release. Some highlights for 6.0 include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A new color panel design saves space, but still shows your options at a glance.&nbsp;</li><li>New border controls offer a simpler way to set your border exactly as you like it.&nbsp;</li><li>Transparency levels for your colors allow for even more creative color options.</li><li>Control gaps, margins, typography, and more on a collection of blocks, all at once, in the Group block.</li><li>Switch between stack, row, and group variations to position groups of blocks with more layout flexibility.</li><li>Use the gap support functionality in the Gallery block to create different looks – from adding spacing between all images, to removing spacing altogether.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting multiple blocks in the list view\" class=\"wp-image-12891\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Better List View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New keyboard shortcuts enable you to select multiple blocks from the list view, modify them in bulk, and drag and drop them within the list. List View can be opened and closed easily; it comes collapsed by default and it automatically expands to the current selection whenever you select a block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Unlocking the block in the block toolbar\" class=\"wp-image-12892\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Locking Controls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can lock your blocks. Choose to disable the option to move a block, remove a block, or both. This simplifies project handover, allowing your clients to unleash their creativity without worrying about accidentally breaking their site in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved Performance in WordPress 6.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes several updates focused on improving the performance of WordPress.

If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\"><em>WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</em></a>, for more details on this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y&#8217;all, we&#8217;ve got an absolutely jam-packed couple of weeks in WordPress. We&#8217;ve got events happening and releases shipping and contributor days being coordinated (I almost said contributor days being contributed). That&#8217;s also what they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;ll share some of those highlights in today&#8217;s small list of big things, but I did want to specifically call out something that&#8217;s coming up this week on Thursday (May 19, 2022), and that something is Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team of contributors over on the Accessibility team has participated in the Global Accessibility Awareness Day in the past. So I thought it would be interesting to hear from one of the co-founders of this particular day of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. And with that, Joe Devin, would you like to tell us a little bit more about yourself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:01:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. So I am the co-founder of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is a day that goes viral every year on the third Thursday of May. We typically have the Twitter reach on the GAAD hashtag on Twitter of 200 million users, which is, I think, pretty much their active user count. We stopped counting once we hit their daily active user count. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, I am Chair of the GAAD Foundation, which we launched last year. And then I have a day job too, where I&#8217;m CEO and co-founder of Diamond, which is an inclusive digital agency that builds software accessibly by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:15]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful. Well, we are so excited to have you today. I said we like it&#8217;s me and the mouse in my pocket—we in the WordPress community that&#8217;s going to listen to this. Super excited to have you today. So you mentioned GAAD, Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Last year was your 10th anniversary, which is very exciting, but like with so many good things, I hear it all started with a blog post and a blog post on WordPress, no less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d love to hear about how GAAD evolved from that, with, as I understand it, your co-founder of Jennison (Asuncion). That must be where you met him, I assume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:02:51] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yes. So what happened was I started a WordPress blog called <em>My SQL Talk</em>. So it&#8217;s a database blog, and I just thought it was a brilliant name. I mean, My SQL Talk, like that, should be super popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it probably had maybe ten people who ever looked. Um, and then my dad was getting older, and my dad was a survivor of the concentration camps, and he was a genius. He spoke ten languages. It, he was one of those people. That, when he walked into a room, he just commanded respect. You knew that there was history. I don&#8217;t know how to explain it really, but it was special when my dad walked into the room. And considering all of this that he suffered in his life, watching him get older and struggle, particularly with his banking, was very painful to see. And the bank wasn&#8217;t accessible, so I wrote this blog post proposing that we create a Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I get these visions, and they never turn into anything. But while I think about it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;all right, let&#8217;s write this blog post and this can definitely work. Right?&#8221; And then you finish the blog post to hit send, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;this is not going to work.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wasn&#8217;t even smart enough to do social media on it. But fortunately, WordPress had an auto-tweet feature, and it tweeted it out, and Jennison Asuncion, my co-founder, happened to be around and not out that Saturday night. And he read the blog post, and he said, &#8220;this is a great idea. Let&#8217;s make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had two busy people, but we both had a community. He had the accessibility community, and I was building a tech scene in Los Angeles. And what I discovered is if you combine a great idea with the community, great things can happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:49]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh man, you&#8217;re speaking my language over here, helping people find their communities, knowing that community is the thing that is the lifeblood of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounded like a tautology. It is not a tautology. You can have a society with an attempt to not have any sort of community around it, but I bet it doesn&#8217;t work very well. Well, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s very interesting. And so you all just kind of talked through what that would look like, I assume in confidence, or that would have to take place, right? Or was it on Twitter in those days?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:05:24]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, you could still look in the comments and see the back and forth of Jennison and a bunch of other people that got pretty involved with GAAD that are some legendary folks in there. It&#8217;s kind of mind-blowing because I dunno how, how you feel, but for me, when I used to code, uh, three months later, I&#8217;d look back at old code and be like, &#8220;oh, I suck,&#8221; you know, or write an email even and you look back on it a day later and are like &#8220;what a stupid email, how stupid am I?&#8221; You know?  But I look back on that one after ten years; I was scared to look at it because I&#8217;m like, it must&#8217;ve been really bad. But you know, it kind of held up, and exactly what I wrote in there happened &#8211; to my utter shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, it&#8217;s kinda nice, though, to look back and be like, &#8220;oh, I used to be much dumber.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause then you&#8217;re like, look how far I&#8217;ve come. I&#8217;m no longer that dumb. I&#8217;m a different kind of dumb now; good for me. I always hope to be a different kind of dumb as I go forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, okay, so that was your ten-year anniversary last year. GAAD, in general, now has been going on for 11 years, and at the time of this recording, in a couple of weeks, but then probably a week when it finally publishes, you have your next, your next round of that going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it seems safe to assume that awareness of the need for accessibility has increased during that time, but we all know that the work of accessibility is ongoing. And so, I&#8217;m just curious to hear from your perspective if the awareness of the need for accessibility has generally started to permeate developer communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And are you seeing more developer awareness around the need for accessibility in tech in general?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:07:12]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You know, it&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s certainly improved a lot.  I keynoted a conference probably four years after GAAD started, maybe five, and I kind of assumed nobody would have heard of accessibility, and I was taken aback when I asked who had heard of it, and a good chunk of the room had. So even then, there had been a difference, and I&#8217;d say now I see accessibility mentioned a lot more in conferences and stuff. But when it comes to actually building it, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of ignorance. There, there still needs to be a lot more awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think partially people are a little bit scared to dip their toe because they&#8217;re scared that they&#8217;re going to be told that &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not accessible,&#8221; or that they&#8217;re going to say the wrong word or offend somebody. So I&#8217;d say that there&#8217;s some degree of trepidation, but also developers, and it&#8217;s not just developers, designers, and product people. There&#8217;s so much to learn, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh God, there&#8217;s another piece that I have to learn.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so glad that you invited me on this podcast because it&#8217;s the developers that, you know, I am a developer, not anymore, I haven&#8217;t touched code in years, but that&#8217;s where I came from. Right? This is my peach, right? Particularly WordPress folks, because I had done a fair bit of WordPress before I moved on to some other things. And, I think we have to talk about usability and understand that accessibility is so much more than how we look at disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m going to ask you a question. How do you think the typical WordPress developer or designer would define disability? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:05] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>in the kinds of conversations that I&#8217;ve had over the years, it frequently has to do with visual things. Because it&#8217;s just screens all day, right? And that&#8217;s a primary area where our designers and developers really have made some effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my personal favorite sort of, of example, for like, when you&#8217;re looking at how to make sure that your products are accessible is, what, if you have to use your website, or you have to build your website using only one arm. Because that gives you an opportunity to kind of look at disability from a permanent standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you have lost permanent use of one arm, but also gives you an opportunity to look at the temporary options for that sort of lack of mobility. Like you&#8217;re a mother with an infant, and so you have to be able to, you know, get your stuff done with one arm. And so I know that we paid a bunch of attention to screen readers and what works in not way back in 2018 and 2019 did a lot of work with. Literally zero screen. And can you still do the thing that you need to do, which was incredibly difficult. And I was really excited to see what our developers came up with around that. But I think that that is quite a bit of that discussion as we&#8217;re going through it from the beginning to the&nbsp;end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:27] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s a great answer, and you definitely understand some of the nuances way better than I think that the average creator, digital product creator, I&#8217;m including the, you know, the product people, the designers, and the developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re very fortunate to have more than just developers in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:50]  </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I bring this up is that the WHO (World Health Organization) had to; they&#8217;re the ones that did massive research across the globe. And they had to, they had to come up with a definition, and in their definition, they needed to draw a line. Typically, I don&#8217;t remember the exact thing cause it&#8217;s a 350-page report, and I kept looking for where they defined it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a little hard to find, but essentially it&#8217;s if there&#8217;s a major disability or a disability that impacts some significant portion of your day-to-day activities. And that&#8217;s really great when you&#8217;re trying to do a report on how many disabilities there are out there; what percentage of the population has a disability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And their figures are something like 15% of the population has a disability, which is a huge number. But at the same time, they also mentioned that 2.2 billion people have a visual impairment. And we also know that over 33% of the population is over 50, and I&#8217;m included in that population. And I can say that when you&#8217;re over 50, you know, I&#8217;ve got clouds in my eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know where they came from, but they definitely make it harder to see. When I&#8217;m in a restaurant, I can&#8217;t focus on the person across from me the same way. My hearing is not the same, and anybody over 50 is going to have certain impairments and won&#8217;t see as well; color contrast issues are a big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to raise the font is a big deal. And I think that accessibility is connected in most people&#8217;s minds with disability. And they&#8217;ll attach that to something like being blind or being deaf or hard of hearing or having a missing limb or having some other kind of disability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t even know any people in that category possibly,&#8221; and as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, how important is this?&#8221; Yes. They might feel guilty. I should do the right thing. This is the right thing to do. But honestly, like how much money should I spend on it? How much, what percentage of my time should I spend on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t realize that everybody has different abilities. And so, I&#8217;m starting to go away from even talking about disabilities and asking people to remember that all of us perceive things differently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember the gold dress where they were trying to say, what color is this dress? Is it gold and white or blue and black? And it is blue and black, but to me, all I see is gold and white. And then there was Laurel or Yanny. Do you remember that?. And some people heard it, and typically older people heard it as Laurel, and I&#8217;ve, and I do this in some of my presentations. I play that, that sound. And usually, it&#8217;s Laurel for me, but sometimes it&#8217;s Yanny. Even personally, it changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we have a totally different perception. Now think about memory. There&#8217;s a different kind of blindness. If you try and remember, let&#8217;s say a relative or a friend that is no longer. How well do you see that picture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because for me, it is very, very vague, but for some people, they say, and I&#8217;ve been asking people, and I&#8217;d love your answer as well. How vivid is it? And some people say, I can read the, I can see the pattern on the shirt. It&#8217;s as vivid as if I see with opening my eyes, seeing, you know, the regular in front of me, and I can even read a name tag in the memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, Woah, so maybe I&#8217;m blind in a way. Right? So how do you see it? How do you remember things?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m a real visual person and a tactile person. And so, like if I interacted with someone, I&#8217;m very likely to be able to picture, like, recreate that mental picture pretty well in my mind. I recently, very recently, met some of my first people in that executive leadership space who were like, yeah, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t visualize things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, what are you, how do you do this work? Because like, you have to be able to do that. And they were like, no, I don&#8217;t have mental pictures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people don&#8217;t have an inner dialogue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand that either,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:19] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me either. So accessibility studies all of these differences with respect to how you&#8217;re presenting all of this information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t pay attention to accessibility, you&#8217;re really just missing out. And then there&#8217;s colorblindness. If you&#8217;re creating something like slack that has an online/offline indicator, and you only use red and green for people who are colorblind, they see gray and gray. And so what I&#8217;m trying to teach the community with digital product creators is that no, you cannot ignore it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ignore accessibility, but then you&#8217;re not good at your job. I mean, I don&#8217;t mean to say it in an offensive way, but you&#8217;re not good at your job if you&#8217;re unaware. If you break a rule on purpose, great. But if you don&#8217;t know the rule, it&#8217;s just a lack of craft, and you absolutely should make it a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re not doing it as a charity. You&#8217;re doing it because you care about your users, and you care about your craft, and you want to build things well, and it&#8217;s a necessity. And I think that this is the kind of message that our community needs to hear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:31]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to touch on something that you sort of brought up a bit, um, at the start of the answer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you brought up the concept of usability. And in the last time that I did a podcast about accessibility, I defined accessibility as a subset of usability. Do you think that if we were to consistently draw that line for people so that it&#8217;s not just like accessibility is this thing that you should do outside of usability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were to more consistently draw that line, do you think that that would help people to see and understand better that its shades of existence, usability, and accessibility?  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:17:10] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, 100%, a hundred percent. And in my company, we kind of realized that that&#8217;s exactly what we have to do. We have to see this as usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t, we talk about accessibility a lot, but I don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s part of the plumbing for us. We&#8217;ve made it part of the plumbing, and I can tell you it&#8217;s a struggle to take accessibility and make it part of an organization, even when you&#8217;re bringing it top-down, believe it or not. For our teams, particularly the designers, they are blown away by what they&#8217;re learning because they&#8217;re improving their craft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And design is typically where there&#8217;s a struggle to get accessibility accepted because there seems to be a very strong idea of what a design should look like. And I think it&#8217;s really about the approach because UX and design it&#8217;s all about empathy for people. And when you approach it, not as, even though empathy should mean that, that, you know, do the right thing at the same time, it&#8217;s more about empathy for your user, and your user includes so much more than just people with disabilities that you haven&#8217;t run into somebody that has that disability and therefore you build it better, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s completely blown their mind. They love it. They love doing it. And I&#8217;m not hiring people with accessibility coming in. We&#8217;re training them to work accessibly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:18:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s interesting that you talk about empathy as part of being able to make sure that you&#8217;re creating something that&#8217;s accessible because I actually feel like empathy is. Like it&#8217;s being considered this gold standard for many, many things right now. And I think it actually is more harmful in the long run than instead making altruistic choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I have a blog post that I will link in our show notes that will kind of help everybody see more fully my concept there. But when you rely on empathy, you do kind of have to rely on one, being able to run into all of the issues you were mentioning. You have to know people who have problems in order to know that the problems exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you also kind of have to assume that once you have willingly put yourself into the discomfort of that kind of disability, whatever, wherever it exists on that spectrum, your experience of that discomfort is the same as someone who lives with it. And I just don&#8217;t think that we can necessarily do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always think that trying to do the altruistic thing, like doing your research and figuring out what it is and trying to make decisions on behalf of other people as best you can, which is a terrible thing. Still, like decisions that take into account the experiences that people are sharing with you and then going to them and saying, &#8220;does this make that experience better or worse?&#8221; is the more sustainable option from my perspective, this is specifically leadership. Still, I think it&#8217;s true for accessibility as well, and probably product design as a whole, but it&#8217;s very difficult. Like people really feel like they understand the concept of empathy right now. And I do think that sometimes that leads us down the wrong path for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s your thought on that? I think you kind of agree based on what your answer was&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:20:33]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no, absolutely. And you know, we, you, can&#8217;t never about us without us, as the common saying, and we&#8217;ve gathered a group of a hundred people with a wide variety of disabilities for research. Whenever we do any UX and research, and sometimes we&#8217;re asked to just do research projects, we go out and ask the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some really interesting companies approach us to do innovation and accessibility, and they had strong assumptions. We looked at the assumptions and agreed with it, but we&#8217;re like, all right, they were smart. They said, &#8220;vet this with users for us, please,&#8221; because they didn&#8217;t want to gather their own group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We vetted with users, and we&#8217;re blown away, always blown away because there are so many things you just don&#8217;t know unless you&#8217;ve lived with a particular disability. You can&#8217;t guess, and you&#8217;ve got to speak to your users and a wide variety of them. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. What role does open source play in expanding accessibility, either in specifically the digital space or just accessibility in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:21:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if the question is, what role does it play? I would say the role it plays is it is, unfortunately, it makes accessibility worse because, for the most part open source is not very accessible. And it&#8217;s a personal passion of mine, so I&#8217;m really glad that you brought that up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it is so bizarre. You write a blog post and then it goes viral, and it goes viral every year to a degree that you can&#8217;t even believe it, that all these companies that you know are running events. Privately, publicly talking about it. And then you get all these people thanking you for what you&#8217;ve done year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then one year, you read on Twitter, The Blind Onion; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with The Onion, the satirical clip, there&#8217;s the Blind Onion. And they tweet out, &#8220;Now that Global Accessibility Awareness Day is over, we look forward to 364 days of global accessibility oblivion.&#8221; And that really hurt at the time, but at the same time, and I was told to ignore it, don&#8217;t worry about it, but I&#8217;m like, no, this is coming from a place of pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the point of GAAD was to make a difference. It wasn&#8217;t too to just give everybody an opportunity to say, &#8220;Hey, look at what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; and then not make a difference. So, as a result of that, I started to think about, well, where are we with this? And, and so I&#8217;ve created a state of accessibility report that through my company, we&#8217;re able to run for a few years, and it&#8217;s not, you know, the state is not great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, well, what can we do to change things? So, as a result of all of this, I really wanted to figure out, well, what can we do to make sure that GAAD does make a difference? And so, I came up with the idea of the GAAD pledge, which is specifically meant for open source frameworks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea of the GAAD pledge is that an open source framework, when they are ready, takes the pledge to make accessibility a core value of the framework. Now, terms of what that actually entails are different for every single project because every project is unique. We did create a bit of a framework, which had the idea of saying, okay, you&#8217;re going to, first of all, create an accessibility statement that says that this framework is going to conform to whatever, WCAG, which is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, to whatever WCAG level is decided and is appropriate for the framework. That there&#8217;s going to be documentation for anybody that is downloading this piece of open source project and trying to implement it, that there should be guidelines for them, that all of the examples should be accessible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really important because even the frameworks that try to pay attention to accessibility. You&#8217;ll often see that people from the community will provide examples, and they&#8217;re inaccessible. And it&#8217;s really sad when you see that because so many people are just copy-pasting. That&#8217;s typically how it works, and they&#8217;re going to copy-paste something bad. So putting a statement around it, I think, would be really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we&#8217;re hoping to see is that lots and lots of big open source communities decide to take the pledge. And then it&#8217;ll sort of be table stakes that any new open source projects as well look, all of these frameworks that made it, they took the pledge and therefore we should take the pledge as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the very first year, we had React Native take the pledge, and they put a lot of effort into their accessibility. The second group to take it was Ember.js, and they always put a lot of effort into their accessibility, and they continued that effort. We&#8217;re about to announce the next one, but we&#8217;re still two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can&#8217;t say anything yet, but yeah, we&#8217;re, uh, we&#8217;re hoping for a lot more uptake on, on the gap pledge because it, it affects so many people downstream. WordPress&#8217;s what percent of the web right now? 43%? So there you go. That&#8217;s so many people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:25:57] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many people. Yeah, fun fact Gutenberg, our current rewriting of the editing experience in WordPress, primarily uses React. And so, I&#8217;m glad to hear that they have taken that pledge as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any good cooking, it starts with good&nbsp;ingredients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:12] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said it. That was great. I wish I was a cook, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:23] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. All right. Let&#8217;s what keeps you up at night when it comes to the state of accessibility?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:29] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What keeps me up at night is how to move the needle. It is such a big thing to change. And there are so many angles that you can approach this with, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a monster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a monster. There are so many legacy sites out there. If you look at WebAIM, they do a yearly report on the state of accessibility as well. They call it the WebAIM Million, and they&#8217;re typically seeing 97% inaccessible, 98%. It goes up and down a little bit every year. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s just a huge boat to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we need to at least get the newer, uh, newer websites and mobile apps to move. And what we&#8217;ve seen in our state of accessibility report is that only the very top companies seem to put in the effort to make their products accessible. There is a big push with the enterprise companies to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CEOs are starting to talk about it, but what we need is the entire culture of software development to change. Or I should even say digital product development change and to move that boat is massive. And that&#8217;s I put it in my tagline in my email like that&#8217;s my mission in life, and I hope to achieve it before I die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that keeps me up at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:52] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that would keep me up at night as well. I mean, it seems like you are really just personally mission-driven and impact-driven. Do you feel like, in the event that the work that you&#8217;ve accomplished so far is what you accomplish, you feel still like you&#8217;ve had an impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like you have had&nbsp;an impact. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not one of those people that tries to have a legacy or like tries to focus on what my impact is and all of that. I just try and do good work. And hopefully, it just shows at the end of the day. I&#8217;m just trying to have the impact without the accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it. Well, Joe, thank you so much for joining us here on this episode of WP Briefing. You have been a delight to chat with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, it&#8217;s really been a pleasure to meet you, and uh, and I appreciate the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:54] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. As I mentioned at the start, it is packed. Number one tomorrow, May 17th, RC3. So one of the final RCs that we&#8217;re going to have for the WordPress 6.0 release, unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong, which I don&#8217;t think it will. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, two days after that, Global Accessibility Awareness Day, as I mentioned, will be on May 19th. So, this coming Thursday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then next week, we have the 6.0 release. We have the WordPress 6.0 release on May 24th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Three days after that, WordPress turns 19 on May 27th, starting its final teenage year before we turn twenty in 2023. So that was the rapid-fire dance card for the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stuff that is happening with and around WordPress for everyone to know. As a heads up, also, many people are headed to WordCamp Europe in Porto(, Portugal). The first week of June, I am going to do a live from WordCamp Europe episode. It will not be live. I&#8217;ll just record it live. And so. You know you&#8217;ll get to hear me with my hoarsest voice and maybe singing to my computer. Cause that almost always happens at these things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12855\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WordPress 6.0 Release Candidate 2 (RC2) Now Available for Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/wordpress-6-0-release-candidate-2-rc2-now-available-for-testing/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 May 2022 18:06:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12840\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:171:\"WordPress 6.0 Release Candidate 2 is now available for testing!

Many content creators have waited for this for years: Now the block editor will actually remember your setting to switch on the Top Toolbar, and switch off the Full-screen view, and switch off the Welcome screen. Now it&#8217;s all stored in the database of your sites. It does not save it across multiple sites, though. WordPress is powerful but not that powerful. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Developer are now empowered <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/extending-the-query-loop-block/\"><strong>extending the Query Loop block</strong></a>. This post <strong>Nik Tsekouras</strong>, explains how you can add your custom query arguments via a block variation of the Query Loop block. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor now also has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/filters-for-theme-json-data/\"><strong>Filters for theme.json data</strong></a>, with it plugin and theme developer can query the styling and layout data for all three levels: Blocks, Themes and User. <strong>André Maneiro</strong> has the details for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Components are the building blocks of core blocks and can also be used for custom blocks.  <strong>Marco Ciampini</strong> explained the <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/editor-components-updates-for-wordpress-6-1/\">Editor Components updates in WordPress 6.1</a>. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Until now, styling via theme.json only worked for blocks and for Global styling. Now theme developers can start <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/styling-elements-in-block-themes/\"><strong>styling elements in block themes</strong></a>,  that means all headers, regardless of where they are added can be consistently styled, same for buttons or input fields. This reduces considerably the lines in a theme&#8217;s custom style.css. This Dev note was authored by <strong>Ben Dwyer</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ramon Dodd</strong> explained in his post the details of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/block-styles-generation-style-engine/\"><strong>Block styles generation (Style Engine)</strong></a>, how the styles found in themes, blocks, Styles UI and core blocks all come together in a black box before they reach the frontend of the site. Or something to that effect. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adam Zielinski </strong>and <strong>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</strong> summarized the  <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/12/block-api-changes-in-wordpress-6-1/\">Block API changes in WordPress 6.1</a>.</strong> They explain several new&nbsp;Block&nbsp;API&nbsp;features available via the&nbsp;<code>block.json</code>&nbsp;file, specifically the new <code>render</code> attribute for dynamic block PHP templates, how multiple scripts can now registered for blocks, and developers can import single core blocks into their apps, rather than all core/blocks/ </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>One of the missing pieces for curating the editing experience were <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/content-locking-features-and-updates/\">Content locking features and updates</a>.</strong> In his dev note, <strong>Jorge Costa</strong> explains how content-only editing for blocks, patterns, and templates, will work and how a template lock inheritance for the Column&nbsp;block functions. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/simplified-data-access-with-new-react-hooks-in-wordpress-6-1/\"><strong>Simplified data access with new React hooks in WordPress 6.1</strong></a>&nbsp;ensure a better WordPress developer experience, we learn from <strong>Adam Zielinski&#8217;</strong>s dev note.  The amount of code necessary to access WordPress data like post, pages, users, or custom post types have been considerably reduced. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In his post <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/reference-styles-values-in-theme-json/\"><strong>Reference Styles values in theme.json</strong></a>, <strong>Ben Dwyer</strong> outlines how you can ensure consistency and avoid duplication of code across entities. If you have a color palette defined, blocks and template parts can reference the particular variable across all other styles so they adhere to the color palette of the theme. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian Alexander</strong> wrote about the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/07/improved-php-performance-for-core-blocks-registration/\"><strong>Improved PHP performance for core blocks registration</strong></a> which is achieved through making sure that only the files required for the blocks on the canvas are loaded in memory. Until now, all 70+ core blocks were loaded all the time. That&#8217;s a huge performance gain for WordPress sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/enhanced-typescript-support-in-wordpress-6-1/\"><strong>Enhanced TypeScript support in WordPress 6.1</strong></a> improves the developer experience for WordPress developers, as most programming tools tap into the Typescript signatures and notify the developer, when there is the wrong type or required arguments are missing. In the video embedded into the post,  <strong>Adam Zielinski</strong> shows the interaction of an&nbsp;IDE&nbsp;for auto-completion and static checks.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ramon Dodd</strong> also write about the implementation of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/03/fluid-font-sizes-in-wordpress-6-1/\"><strong>Fluid font sizes in WordPress 6.1</strong></a>. You learn how they work and how you can control them via the theme.json file. This is another feature improving the overall responsiveness of the block editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In the post, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/miscellaneous-editor-changes-for-wordpress-6-1/\"><strong>Miscellaneous editor changes for WordPress 6.1</strong></a>, you learn about the small changes and sometime also make a big difference, for instance, content patterns for custom post types, improvements to the Cover block, or a new filter for he Navigation block. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a consistent UI for blocks, was one of the focuses for this WordPress release. The team is about 50% there. In this <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/roster-of-design-tools-per-block/\"><strong>Roster of design tools per block</strong></a>, you can look up which blocks have which set of design tools in the categories: Typography, Color, Dimension, Border, and Layout controls. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-gutenberg-14-3-released\">Gutenberg 14.3 released</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aaron Robertshaw</strong>  was the release lead for version 14.3 of the Gutenberg plugin.

The steps he explains are: Install a WordPress block theme, customize your theme with the Site Editor, export your modifications as a new block theme. Morris works through all that using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/\">Create Block Theme plugin</a> by the WordPress team in the plugins repository. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian Gardner</strong> shared in his post <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/builders/box-shadow-style-blocks/\"><strong>Create a Box-shadow Style for Various Blocks</strong></a> the necessary code snippets to add box shadow to Images, Buttons, and Quote Blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Julio Marchi</strong> explored <a href=\"https://thedigitalinsider.com/why-classic-wordpress-themes-arent-going-away/\"><strong>Why Classic WordPress Themes Aren’t Going Away</strong></a> on the blog The Digital Insider. One of the reasons is that classic themes provide a higher flexibility to build advanced bespoke themes. Marchi also points out that new features comeing to WordPress include ways for classic themes to make use of the theme.json file as well as the feature to allow block-theme template parts to be added to classic themes and offer patterns for those templates parts. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>New on WordPress TV: <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2022/10/14/lets-code-creating-custom-templates-and-template-parts/\"><strong>Let’s code: creating custom templates and template parts</strong></a> with <strong>Jonathan Bossenger</strong>. WordPress 6.1 will include ways to create custom templates and template parts for your block theme from the Site Editor. Bossenger shows in this video how you can register and create custom templates and template parts from the editor, as well as how to register them in your theme.json file when distributing your new block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>On CSS Tricks, <strong>Ganesh Dahal</strong> published a tutorial on how to <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/fluid-typography-wordpress-block-themes/\"><strong>add Fluid Typography Support to WordPress Block Themes</strong></a>.

Kägy is an Associate Director of Editorial Engineering at 10up, an agency with plenty of contributions to the WordPress open-source project. They built highly visible websites, like The White House, Five Thirty Eight, or the World Economic Forum. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kägy wrote in his post:  &#8220;Our Gutenberg Best Practices are meant to work in tandem with the WordPress Core documentation and expand upon its foundation to provide a more client-services-centric approach tailored to engineering enterprise-level editorial experiences.&#8221; The microsite is divided up on Training, Reference, and Guides.  Check it out. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nathan Wrigley</strong> had <strong>Nick Diego</strong> as guest on the 46th episode of the WPTavern Jukebox podcast and discussed <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/46-nick-diego-on-why-you-should-be-excited-about-the-possibilities-of-wordpress-blocks\"><strong>Why You Should Be Excited About the Possibilities of WordPress Blocks</strong></a>. Wrigley wrote: &#8220;It’s becoming easier to create the blocks, as the tools take away much of the technical burden of getting you up and running without advanced knowledge of JavaScript and React. Coupled with core components, native block supports, and a bit of guidance, Nick thinks that every WordPress developer can add custom blocks to their repertoire.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian Coords</strong> discovered the <a href=\"https://www.briancoords.com/wordpress-secret-world-of-javascript/\"><strong>WordPress’ Secret World of JavaScript</strong></a>, when taking the new Course on <em>Learn.WordPress</em> <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/using-the-wordpress-data-layer/\">Using the WordPress Data Layer</a>. Coords also marveled on the fact that all the great tools available to allow developers to build on basis of WordPress outside the block editor for instance on settings pages of a plugin or on supplement admin pages and not many are using them (yet). </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cameron Jones</strong> also shared his experience developing around the block editor and found: <a href=\"https://cameronjonesweb.com.au/blog/adding-a-custom-icon-to-the-social-links-block-should-not-be-this-hard/\"><strong>Adding A Custom Icon To The Social Links Block Should Not Be This Hard</strong></a>. His task was to add another service and icon to the core&#8217;s Social Block. Jones takes us along his journey of figuring out how to accomplish this task. There were a few U-turns and cul-de-sac moments on the way. I found it quite an interesting read, as it elaborated on the gaps that need to be closed for the Gutenberg project to be more attractive to extenders in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to believe Jones, it was not missing documentation. &#8220;And to my pleasant surprise, the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-variations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">official documentation</a> was quite good in this regard.&#8221; he wrote. And after going through all the up and downs of learning new things, Jones concluded: <em>&#8220;The provision of the <code>@wordpress/scripts</code> package and much improved documentation makes me feel far more confident in starting to approach development for the block editor again.&#8221;</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I have to agree with Jones: it shouldn&#8217;t be so hard to add another block variations to a block that mostly sports block variations out of the box. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In his tutorial <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/rendering-external-api-data-in-wordpress-blocks-on-the-front-end/\"><strong>Rendering External API Data in WordPress Blocks on the Front End</strong></a>, <strong>Manoj Kumar</strong> shows you how to build a dynamic block that fetches data from an external API and renders it on the frontend when a particular block is dropped into the Block Editor of a post. He uses the create-block scaffolding tool to get started, fetches data with <code>useEffect()</code> and store the data in the database and retrieves for the block rendering on the front end. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/need-a-zip-from-master/\">Need a plugin .zip from Gutenberg&#8217;s master branch?</a></strong><br />Gutenberg Times provides daily build for testing and review. <br />Have you been using it?

It can also be converted to a Custom HTML block or removed entirely at the user&#8217;s discretion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>UniBlock&#8217;s 19 custom block patterns include everything one might expect from a business theme but, most impressively, it ships with five full-page patterns:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Front Page</li>\n\n\n\n<li>About</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Services</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blog</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Contact</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, users can assign the page template in the post settings to get the same effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These full-page patterns are convenient for speedy page building. They make it possible to get a basic business website up in a matter of minutes. Here&#8217;s an example of the Services full-page pattern that will instantly embed when selected. Users can delete any sections they don&#8217;t need, add more blocks and patterns, and quickly fill in all their own information.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Separately there are patterns for a footer with text, links, multiple arrangements of featured boxes with text and button, multiple designs for call-to-action sections, pricing tables, team members with social icons, testimonials, header cover, sidebar, 404 page, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can delve even further into customizing the templates with the site editor, as UniBlock is packaged with nearly two dozen templates and template parts. Here they can also edit the menu and adjust global styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>WPZOOM is developing a Pro version of the theme to release in a few weeks with support for importing the whole demo, multiple color schemes, multiple demos, premium block patterns, and additional header and footer layouts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://demo.wpzoom.com/uniblock/\">Check out the demo</a> on the WPZOOM website to see the theme in action. WPZOOM has also written <a href=\"https://www.wpzoom.com/documentation/uniblock\">documentation for UniBlock</a>, which covers general topics like how to use block patterns, how to set up the front and blog pages, and how to create a menu in the site editor. Since the company&#8217;s most popular themes are what would be considered classic themes, UniBlock is new territory for most of their customers. It is so far the only block theme among WPZOOM&#8217;s collection of 31 themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block theme adoption is slowly making its way across WordPress&#8217; major theme shops and the official directory is now hosting 160 themes tagged for full-site editing. As more longtime theme companies make their block theme debuts and develop a base for future themes, WordPress users may start to see a rapid acceleration of the number and variety of block themes available. UniBlock is so far one of the few block themes in the directory with a singular focus on business websites. It is available to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/uniblock/\">download for free from WordPress.org</a> or via the admin themes panel.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 01:00:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"Post Status: Does WordPress.org Data Belong to the WordPress Community?

At the <strong>WP Watercooler</strong> and elsewhere, a realization seems to be setting in that the data is <em>not</em> open source and <em>not</em> the property of the WordPress community. Like last week\'s episode of <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> with <strong>Katie Keith</strong> of <strong>Barn2 Plugins</strong>, <strong>Till Krüss</strong> (<strong>Object Cache Pro</strong>, <strong>Relay</strong>) offers a lot of lessons this week about less travelled paths to success in the plugin business even as a very small company or company of one. Performance, testing, and support are key, interrelated parts of Till\'s success and probably the most important ones to borrow in your own life and work if they resonate.  </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer eplus-wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"yoast-reading-time__wrapper\"><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__icon\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__spacer\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__descriptive-text\">Estimated reading time:  </span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__reading-time\">4</span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__time-unit\"> minutes</span></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-why-the-wordpress-org-growth-charts-don-t-matter\"><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/active-install-charts-removed-from-plugin-repo/\">Why the WordPress.org Growth Charts Don\'t Matter</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><strong>Alex Denning</strong> pointed out in the <strong>Ellipsis</strong> newsletter that in 2019-20, only four plugins entered the space and broke into the upper tiers. These were <strong>Site Kit</strong> for <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong> for <strong>WooCommerce</strong>, <strong>Creative Mail for WordPress and WooCommerce</strong>, and <strong>Google Ads and Marketing</strong> by <strong>Kliken</strong>. Has the WordPress.org repository become a closed shop, a tapped-out ecosystem where the winners have taken all? Here are some suggestions about how to break in or changes that could be proposed to open and diversify the repository. Until that happens, do growth charts matter?

That\'s a mouthful but a quick way to describe the many facets of <strong>Till Krüss</strong>&#8216;s business built around <strong>Object Cache Pro</strong>, “a business class <strong>Redis</strong> object cache backend for WordPress.” OCP offers a unique and highly successful model for partnerships between a WordPress plugin product business and two valuable niche markets: hosting companies (B2B) for $1,950/month and anyone running WordPress sites at scale (D2C) for $95/month. <strong>Nexcess</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.nexcess.net/blog/nexcess-to-provide-premium-caching-to-all-customers-with-new-object-cache-pro-partnership/\">the latest host to adopt</a> OCP, which they announced earlier this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Till’s particular niche is not for everyone, but some of his ideas and achievements are very portable. For one thing, what plugin owner has not felt the pain of an extraordinarily busy support forum? Till is up to (wait for it…) 10 <em>minutes</em> a day on support — which he aims to decrease to five minutes. How? End-to-end unit testing to ensure the highest code quality. It’s an idea that needs to become a reality and a habit in the third-party WordPress product ecosystem, Till believes — and I think he’s right about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://objectcache.pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Object Cache Pro</a> is a (closed-source) commercial product that grew out of and is developed alongside <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/redis-cache/\">Redis Object Cache</a>. (100k+ installs on WordPress.org, numerous forks and stars on <a href=\"https://github.com/rhubarbgroup/redis-cache\">GitHub</a>.) <strong>Redis Object Cache</strong> is a fork of an unmaintained precursor <a href=\"https://ethitter.com/2014/04/redis-object-cache-plugin-available-for-download/\"><strong>Erick Hitter</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://ttmm.io/tech/ludicrous-speed-wordpress-caching-with-redis/\"><strong>Eric Mann</strong></a> launched <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/redis-object-cache-wordpress/\">in 2014</a>. </li><li><a href=\"https://relay.so/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Relay</a> looks like it will be a successor to OCP as it\'s capable of speeds up to 100 times faster than Redis. It\'s a PHP extension developed in C that is both a Redis client and a shared in-memory cache.&#8221; There is a free Community version.</li><li><strong>Felipe Elia</strong> recently wrote a great explainer on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://felipeelia.dev/wordpress-object-cache-and-redis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress, Object Cache, and Redis</a>.

Viewed over 15 years, the market peak appears to have been reached in 2014, although the middle and upper tiers have had a more level and wave pattern of ups and downs beneath the dramatic rise and fall of new 100k-500k install plugins, at least between 2007-16.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A &#8220;Closed Shop&#8221;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019-20, only four plugins entered the space and broke into the upper tiers.

(Here I am in 2010, writing <a href=\"https://corymiller.com/why-we-need-a-premium-wordpress-plugin-market/\">Why We Need a Premium WordPress Plugin Market</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I want to do here is frame the conversation to be constructive and help us all make progress together — for the good of WordPress, plugin developers, and our members. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ll try to offer as limited a commentary as I can here because I\'d like your comments and responses to these questions: </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-are-plugins-essential-to-wordpress\">1. Are plugins essential to WordPress?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, have (free and paid) plugins been — and will they continue to be — essential to the health and growth of WordPress? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My answer is YES — <em>absolutely!</em> Even if it\'s a messy market. And we have work to do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of this writing, there were listed 60,229 plugins in the WP repo, and of course countless other free and paid plugins elsewhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins are key contributions to WordPress. They extends WordPress and allows WP to stay as nimble as possible for the enormous variety of uses in our world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started iThemes in 2008. We were early in the &#8220;premium&#8221; market. We didn\'t have to depend on the repo at the time, but I would have relished the opportunity to offer and sell our products there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your answer to my first question is a solid <em>yes</em> too — and I hope it is — then my next question is:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. What can we do to create a more sustainable model and environment for WP plugin developers?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THIS</strong> is where we need to start the conversation, in my view. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Merely suggesting to plugin developers committed to the WP.org repository that if they don\'t like the rules or changes they should go elsewhere isn\'t fair or reasonable to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\'re saying that to plugin developers, but&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You don\'t own a free plugin&#8230;</li><li>You haven\'t built your business around a free plugin&#8230;</li><li>You were early into the product business like I was at iThemes in 2008&#8230;</li><li>You already have an existing platform outside of the .org repo&#8230;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;then at best, you\'re not putting yourself in their shoes. You\'re not offering realistic advice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also don\'t think it\'s the best or healthiest answer for them or WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I\'m talking about and asking for are ideas that make incremental progress and improvement &#8230; TOGETHER. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For WordPress and the plugin developer ecosystem to start a dialogue that is perhaps overdue. I also want to keep in mind that this is an open source project, with projects teams and volunteers who are already overloaded. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we start with this question:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>What are the big three things we as a larger WP community (together) can start working toward to support WP plugin devs better?</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ll offer some ideas to kick off this conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Let\'s agree we\'re all in this together. </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s so much division and polarization in our world already today outside of WP. In the spirit of open source and WP, let\'s be a shining example to our worlds of what can be when humans start talking and listening to fellow humans. Leaving some of our past behind and simply understanding where we\'re coming from. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at its simplest? <strong>Be open to the conversation. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its best? <strong>Try to embody the other\'s perspective.</strong> Getting into their shoes.

It\'s about time we published it as an episode of <strong>Post Status Draft</strong>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Till is the developer and owner of <strong>Object Cache Pro</strong>, &#8220;a business class <strong>Redis</strong> object cache backend for WordPress.&#8221; OCP offers a unique and highly successful model for partnerships between a WordPress plugin product business and two valuable niche markets: hosting companies (B2B) for $1950/month and anyone running WordPress sites at scale (D2C) for $95/month. <strong>Nexcess</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.nexcess.net/blog/nexcess-to-provide-premium-caching-to-all-customers-with-new-object-cache-pro-partnership/\">the latest host to adopt</a> OCP, which they announced earlier this week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>What plugin owner has not felt the pain of an extraordinarily busy support forum? Till is up to (wait for it..) 10 <em>minutes</em> a day on support — which he aims to decrease to five minutes. How? End-to-end unit testing to ensure the highest code quality.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance optimization in general — and caching in particular — are <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/2022-web-almanac-cms-report/\">possibly the oldest and most persistent hard problems</a> for people running WordPress and similar applications at scale. Historically, performance has been a problem passed to the hosting industry by WordPress developers and users of too many plugins — or too many plugins that use too many server resources, especially as measured in database queries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper\">Till’s particular niche is not for everyone, but some of his ideas and achievements are very portable. For one thing, what plugin owner has not felt the pain of an extraordinarily busy support forum? Till is up to (wait for it&#8230;) 10 <em>minutes</em> a day on support — which he aims to decrease to five minutes. How? End-to-end unit testing to ensure the highest code quality. It’s an idea that needs to become a reality and a habit in the third-party WordPress product ecosystem, Till believes — and I think he’s right about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Test Everything, End-to-End</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A large part of the challenges people have with WordPress in the wild have to do with plugins that have not been built and tested to perform at scale. There’s likely a lot of opportunity in aligning people on performance as a key, common interest. What people are these? Product, agency, and hosting companies in the WordPress space. <em>And</em>, as Till’s example shows, a small WordPress company, or company of one that wants to stay that way, still can thrive today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Quality Product = Nearly No Support Needs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, plugin owners have struggled with burdensome customer support, and having to resort to support as a customer is always an unwanted burden. Neither party wants to relate primarily through the support desk! So &#8230; why not just eliminate it or diminish support needs as much as possible? It\'s a win for everyone, and resources go into product development, another win-win. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing and Value</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Object Cache Pro\'s sales and distribution through hosting partnerships leave support obligations with the hosting partner and their own customers. The value to hosts is how they can bundle OCP, a high-value product, at a low cost to their customers\' hosting plans. This leaves OCP focused on product development, quality assurance, and lower support/maintenance costs — which is in everyone\'s interest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Object Cache Pro\'s Direct-to-Consumer pricing has no SaaS component. It does come with support, but customers are expected to install and maintain OCP themselves without an additional white-glove support plan. The value proposition: It just works and delivers incredible performance gains that have a quantifiable dollar value on high-traffic sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should we continue this conversation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you\'re interested in a follow-up</em> conversation with Till or have questions about the things we covered in this one, please get in touch.

I know that, um, Cloud Linux is using now Spin up, WP Blue Host. A lot of big hosts are using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I\'m here with Till..</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> <em>Krüss</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> &#8230;and we\'re going to be talking about Object Cache Pro, which Till launched at the end of 2019. It\'s a business class Redis Object Cache backend for WordPress that\'s used by GoDaddy, Pagely Nexus Cloud Ways, and Convesio. The free, open-source version, Redis Object Cache is available at wordpress.org on the plugin repo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes WordPress much, much faster. Till\'s also building [00:01:00] Relay Redis client that\'s two orders of magnitude (100x) faster, and there are Laravel, WordPress, and Magento integrations for it. Till\'s a company of one and has a really unique view of how he wants to do business in the WordPress space. We\'ll spend some time talking about that, how Till got into WordPress in the first place as a very self-taught developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we\'ll talk about performance and testing in the WordPress plugin ecosystem. Why there needs to be more of it and why this matters to WordPress\'s Growth and competitiveness. Before we get into that, let me tell you about one of our great sponsors, Pressable. Founded in 2010. Pressable is a world class managed WordPress hosting provider built on the same data network as wordpress.com and WordPress VIP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their state of the [00:02:00] art platform empowers agencies, freelancers, e-commerce businesses, IT professionals, and WordPress developers.

It\'s a 50 50 split, more or less between object, cash, Pro and relay. Right. Which hasn\'t really, you know,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> been too public. Relay that\'s, um, how much is, is that coming back into WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s a kind of a larger PHP project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> Yeah. Without, you know, diving off the deep end here, essentially, I spoke with a bunch of people. The result was Object Cash Pro. And once I released this, you know, enterprise grade object cashing solution hosting companies came to me and be like, Hey, we want even more performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the last two years, me and Michael, um, mostly him, but the [00:04:00] last two years we spent building Relay because it\'s the, it\'s a nice addition. And to answer your question about, Back to WordPress is like, yes. However, we are expanding into the, The extension works with laville magenta, with all PHP frameworks, messes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not only restricted to WordPress, but I assume this is gonna be the right dominant market. The first couple of years object. Cing is a very WordPress specific term. You see it here and there in other frameworks, but often it\'s just called caching. They just say, Hey, we just throw something into the cash and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then they differentiate between page caching and all the other things. In WordPress, it\'s a specific term called object caching, but really it\'s, it\'s a, yeah, it\'s a WordPress specific thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> So what, what, how would you define object caching? I have kind of a metaphor, simplification for it in my, in my mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what\'s, what\'s a semi-technical. Deeper technical understanding of, of what we\'re doing [00:05:00] with object caching in, in WordPress,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> how I define it. There\'s some really good articles written out there. I think someone just posted something a few days ago. I dunno if I can pull this up right now. Um, Interesting Filipe ira.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. He just posted something. . We should put his initial notes. He has nice illustrations and he explains it. Um, essentially object hashing is you, you know, database might MariaDB all the S SQL queries that typically quite slow at scale, the more low you put on it. If you have a thousand people asking questions at the send them, it can be a bit much so at word pr Let\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to fetch the most recent comments and it gives you 20 comments instead of always asking your database server for it, you throw it into the object cash. I\'m doing air quotes here, which can be backed by many different service or architectures. In my case with object [00:06:00] cash Pros, cuz I think it\'s a really neat piece of software home and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of, you know, the next couple of visitors, they don\'t have to ask the database. You don\'t have to wait your time to first buy. It doesn\'t increase. You can just throw it into Redis and retrieve it really, really quickly. And Redis doesn\'t really break a sweat. If you have a thousand people asking questions, it\'s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe at a hundred thousand, a million, then you know, it starts to consume some resources. But it\'s just a really, really fast key value store. And. Ultimately object cashing helps you reduce the load on your database, which in most cases, I wanna say unless you have these, you know, 250 plugin, web percent stalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Big chunk of your response time is always taking up by talking to the database, right? Mm-hmm. ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I, I haven\'t seen a lot of 250 plugin my press installs. You run into those very often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> Uh, I don\'t, I not directly, but [00:07:00] you know, working. The guys at Page Lee and some other hosting companies I see. Really horrendous What setups that it\'s, it feels abusive, what they\'re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s just, it\'s, it\'s cruel what, what they\'re doing with the service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right? Yeah. I I\'m sure there\'s, there\'s plenty of, We\'ve probably touched a few of those here and here and there. Everyone\'s experience, um, just keep adding to it. Mm-hmm. . But the, the thing with Adri cash, um, That\'s really valuable is it doesn\'t matter whether those queries come from the back end or whether you\'re in the Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unit or not. And that\'s traditionally been people are working, um, doing a lot of writing inside their content management. And then if you have multiple users back there, there\'s really nothing that traditional cash would. Offer you. I remember there was this old plugin, um, I used for a long time. Mark Jake with, had written that, um, did try to do some smart things to cash some on the back end, [00:08:00] um, when you had multiple users going, but.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, if, if you\'re caching, well, it\'s not, Is it caching queries? Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> yeah, , it\'s unclear. Um, it\'s not a query. Cash query caching would be select user one from, you know, WP Onco users that would be specifically cashing this result. And some MyQ Marie BI was actually do this internally. If the same query happens, then they just send a cash response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s more that WordPress says, Hey, I wanna. Look up this one user and then WordPress function itself. Check, Do I already have this in cash? Instead of cashing the query, it just cashes the object. Hence object cashing. But to speak to what you said earlier, they\'re just there. Yes. The advantage of object cashing, I always, I\'m so involved in it, so I forget how to properly explain it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe in the, Explain to me like I\'m five, the big advantages. It\'s easy to install a plugin like WP Rocket or. , [00:09:00] I don\'t know what the go-to standard is nowadays to get some browser cashing going. So if you have anonymous traffic, if you have the Google crawler going to your website, that you serve these static pre-generated HDML files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you don\'t have even talk to anything, you just, the server just has to redefine and send it back, which is really, really fast, like milliseconds. However, the moment you\'re logged in, if you have a community. Buddy boss, or if you have something here, shopping cart with wms, you\'re not an anonymous visitor anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then every request when you wanna browse to the next category in wms, for example, you always have to talk to my sequel. And now if you do a flash sale with a thousand people at the same time on you site, You always will hit the object cash and it\'s just nice that it\'s whether you\'re in the back end, whether you are logged in, used on the front end with a shopping guard or you know, just commented, object cashing will reduce the response times of the page load times [00:10:00] for all of these requests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only anonymous traffic. It\'s really good to have both, to have a page cash and an object cash because you know, a fast back end, maybe even the page generation. when you run your, Hey, warm up my page cash would be faster because it doesn\'t have to hammer your my SQL server. Um, but yeah, that\'s, that\'s the, the essence, it, it cashes all requests or all it cashes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s not true. It cashes many parts that affect all requests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Yeah. I noticed the big difference, uh, when we started using it, uh, with Pagely, and I think in some other context I have, um, yeah. Cause that\'s traditionally been the, the big problem with, with WordPress, if you\'re trying to use it as a community site or you, you\'ve got a forum or, uh, Yeah, some of a social site and a lot of people are logged in, so there\'s very little that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That page cashing would do anything for. So, um, [00:11:00] In my recollection, that was the major problem hosts had. There were more and more WordPress sites and others of its generation. They\'re all PHP in my sequel. Um, and so you would have someone just getting hammered with a lot of concurrent visitors. Maybe they don\'t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe the page doesn\'t. Has like 50, a hundred queries. It\'s reasonable, but there\'s like 300 people doing that all at once. Or you have someone who has like the 250 plugins and it\'s like a hundreds of queries to load the, the front page. And it took a close look at that at one point with, uh, with another guy on the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And um, you would see like one, even if it was one out of a hundred queries that just went. It just never came back. , and you wouldn\'t get a full page load. Um, was that, is that still a [00:12:00] scaling issue that every host has to deal with? Um, or is that becoming a thing of the past? With, with stuff like object</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> cashing, having an object, Cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what press helps, um, because it\'s not really designed. To run a community to run these highly dynamic sites. We\'re making dm, we\'re making it work. I think the buddy boss guys talked to me recently and they said that just a load of feed of any given user, like you logged in, lot of feed. It\'s 300 my queries or SQL queries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people I think, use Marie db. I can\'t speak too much about what the challenges of hosting companies are. Um, I do see. Here and there, The stories and scaling the database over seems often an issue. I don\'t know what it\'s like in shared hosting. This is not my expertise, but yeah. Um, it\'s a, it\'s a hard [00:13:00] challenge to, to scale WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s, And it\'s my business now, it\'s, it\'s hard to scale and we have better tools, we have more powerful service. It\'s working, but it\'s, it\'s definitely pushing the edge of what it\'s meant to be doing initially. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> And is that how you got into this? Just because, well, you had a kind of history with WordPress and, and Lael, um, does it naturally, Does the nature of working with a WordPress for long lend itself to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Man, I gotta deal with some performance issues. Um, but what was your way into that? Becoming a</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> main focus? Yeah, I was working as a freelancer and I was working on this really large Ttra community, um, as a women run company, which was kind of funny as like, I think when I left there was 50 women and me, and it was a fantastic work environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could say and. [00:14:00] The, It was like online learning, online courses. We didn\'t really have any tools when we started. I think I know 10 years ago, eight years ago, there was no good tools out there and at some point we started using Access Ally to connect with part and was just always a performance nightmare and I wanted to use an object answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ran into the same problem that now people run into and come to me essentially, or to other people like Pan. And they\'ve got a reddish caching plug in as well. That\'s, the data was just a sudden there so much load, page load signs were low and each page had, you know, three, 400 comments and just to load them, it was just not feasible to always ask the SQL Server and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saw what\'s out there and it was kind of a bit dire, the situation. So I forked one of, I do not remember who it was. There was a popular Redis plugin, but Eric man, Eric man, I think way back in the day, released something where it was just unmaintained. I forked it, and now it grew to like, [00:15:00] I know a hundred thousand users probably a lot more because most people just use the upstream object cash drop and not the full plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that, um, Cloud Linux is using now Spin up, WP Blue Host. A lot of big hosts are using it, so the 100,000 users might be with Misleading, and I just scratched my own itch. I needed a good Redis plugin and it just kept on growing. That\'s how I kind of, you know, got into this and got started with it. I, I needed faster page load times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, I think that\'s, that\'s a, not that un uncommon of a, of a story, but you, what\'s unique is to, to build a product as, as successful as, um, as Object Cash Pro, I imagine. Um, how many, how many hosting partners are you working with now with that? Because it\'s a, there\'s the free plugin, but then there\'s the, um, the, there\'s the, [00:16:00] I guess the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top shelf, high, high end premium version, that that\'s, is that mostly gonna be of use to a hosting market?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> Um, yeah. And individual, like the small medium businesses that, you know, if you run an eCommerce side, and we have many customers like that. Mm-hmm. , they have eCommerce sites, they make $50,000 a month in revenue and they run their own either infrastructure, have a tiny engineering team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two, three guys run their own infrastructure because often when you have these large scale sites, it\'s tricky to find a hosting company that will serve that. Right. And I recommend Pagely personally because they seem to be able to just scale out. Um, What was the question again? ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I\'m thinking Yeah. Whether I That was hosting buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Answered it. Yeah. If so, there are larger, So, so the, the client market for object cash bros is not just hosts, but businesses that are large [00:17:00] enough where they\'re monthly revenue, they can quantify exactly what performance is costing them. Yes. So if you are shaving. Off $10,000 worth of bandwidth. You know, it\'s, it, you, you can be that precise about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That that\'s, um, yeah. You know, this is a measurable quantity and your, your value is, um, auto, it sells itself, I suppose. Right. Is that, is that kind of how you</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> approach? Yeah, and because I believe in open source, there\'s always the free version that gives you a lot of benefits already. Um, there\'s been these studies from Amazon, Walmart, Etsy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google where every 10th of a second a hundred milliseconds page load delays cost you. I think 1% conversion rate. Companies who worry about those numbers, they should be using Object, cash Pro. Yeah. Or if you just want the best of the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, there\'s that side of it too. That\'s it. It\'s probably fairly quantifiable what you\'re losing in customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:00] Um, and just you\'re paying for less efficient, You\'re paying to lose customers if you, if you can\'t, can\'t serve, um, pages efficiently at scale. So, All right. Um, Do you want to talk more about your, your background and, and history, or do you like to, you know, I imagine there\'s some things farther back that maybe suggest some things about you and, and why you shaped your business this way, because, We\'ve talked about that before, and you know, this isn\'t, this isn\'t something you want to grow into, uh, a massive company where you become a manager of, of a support desk , or you, you know, that\'s under you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'ve got people, you\'ve got engineers and, and support people. Um, this is something you wanted to remain hands on and, um, in a particular way so, Are there things in your experience and you know, the rest of life that made you aware of that, [00:19:00] um, about yourself? Because, you know, the standard stereotypical model is let\'s like on, let\'s make this thing as big as we can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Yeah. Cava</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> dozen,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah. I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m neuro atypical and I, whatever. I touched a knife I wanted to do, figured out myself. I mean, I, I really enjoy learning from other people and I constantly ask other people about things and advice, but. Just seeing the standard model of you start a business, you get some funding, then you rent an offer, and I just, I can\'t be asked to, to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I wanna do things my way. That works for me, meaning working from home, I. In my underwear. Kind of, that\'s the, the picture you, you can visualize there. I, it works for me to be quiet by myself to focus time. If I want to take three [00:20:00] days off, I will and not be forced into this nine to five productivity model because it doesn\'t serve my, I don\'t wanna say best interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve never really articulated this. Um, it doesn\'t work for me. It\'s, I work long, hard hours, sometimes months in a row and sometimes I just take time off and all I wanna do is mo lawn and go for work. That flexibility, I think, really allowed me to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>maybe make the best product I could possibly make. And I just essentially, I just wanted to do things my way. Even with the pricing model, of course, looking at all the other WordPress plugins, this pricing model, I think hasn\'t changed in the last 10 years. Five years. I don\'t know what the first paid plugin was except for, was it, um, Kareem with crowd favorite?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He had this one plug and I was, I dunno, [00:21:00] $500 a month or like some crazy amount, the, where you could migrate between sites with this one outlier. Everybody does the same pricing with, you know, a couple of dollars a month, maybe less than a hundred a year, and you get your unlimited license to me didn\'t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to keep it small. I wanted to have a hundred customers that pay me a hundred dollars a month. That would be my full-time work and support a hundred companies individually. That was the initial intention support a hundred companies because I can\'t, that wouldn\'t, wouldn\'t be too far out of my capabilities and it wouldn\'t completely drown me in work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that\'s how I really priced ocp. This is, this is what I wanted and. What I\'m seeing now is that I can serve the WebPress industry much more by working with hosting companies, and I\'m talking with a lot more than, uh, listed on my website officially, who already, you know, signed up. There\'s a few bigger announcements coming now with Word Cam BS that I don\'t think I can talk about or would be, It\'s not my [00:22:00] place to her to share these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but yeah, I just, I wanted to. I wanna do this, do things my way. That was, it was really important to me, and I\'m really glad I did because I\'m also seeing that I don\'t think I\'m a good employer. Um, unlike people. What\'s his face? Joshua? Joshua Trouble? Yes. I think he was a really, it\'s, he seemed, Maybe you can leave some notes here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, if anybody\'s working for him. He seems like a really good boss and, I\'d like to be like him, but I\'m not, or at least not at this point. And may, maybe I\'ll get there and I want to grow and scale. What, what I would like is I would like someone to come in, be the CT cto, as ceo, take over the company, and I\'m down with whether this is raising money or.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting, you know, with all the acquisitions, I think it makes sense for a established, skilled team to come in and grow this. But as long as I\'m [00:23:00] not on my own, but have a very small team, which I have right now, I don\'t, I don\'t wanna just grow and grow and grow. That\'s not my, I wanna create a good product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanna have happy customers and not have depression because I\'m burning the candle at both. . Yeah. Do</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> do you think that, that to me doesn\'t, man, I, I, I resonate with that a lot. I, I feel that a lot. I, I feel like there\'s a lot of, well, maybe not a lot, but proportionally, but that there\'s a, there\'s a culture in, in WordPress among developers and, and others that is kind of the smallest, beautiful Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approach. And have you found other, like others? Kind of supporting, validating that or other people you think have done</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> that except that all the smallest beautiful gets bought up. . Yeah, they do. But then because we have these, oh, what do you call them? [00:24:00] Conglomerates now, like with the cloud waste acquisition today, um, by digital ocean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are these giant, I dunno, visually speaking skyscrapers, you know, there\'s a bunch of them, but there are so many CRAs in the pavement in between that where smallest, beautiful can grow and you have like beautiful little happy, healthy flowers. I don\'t know what the, where the analogy is going. Um, There\'s space to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s always issues in between where you have small companies that can solve a problem that there\'s so many that exist in workers and create a really good solution, and then they will grow and maybe they\'ll be bought up and integrated in the big sky scrapers. Maybe not that, that it doesn\'t really matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s always space for small, whether it\'s a startup or just a small business or your, your site project to, to flourish. I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, I was thinking of John Christopher, who\'s you, you probably saw some of that in post [00:25:00] Slack and his give attention because it\'s an unusual, um, approach with organized wp. Um, yeah, he goes way back with, He\'s very intentional about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that\'s actually a project that has a previous plugin behind it goes back 10 years or so. So even when he was doing search WP and from what I was reading and hearing, A large part of it sounds, sounds like you, where part of the thinking is not just a technical or revenue oriented planning, but how is this something that fits into my life where my relationship with my customers is meaningful?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and that kind of connects with what I\'m hearing from you about like yeah, you don\'t want the, the stress. Over promising and delivering cuz your own scale has gotten out. Like, that\'s, that\'s what I\'ve found most painful and personally a barrier in, um, [00:26:00] freelancing. You know, if, if you\'re doing you, it doesn\'t, it wasn\'t, it\'s not something that quality can maintain at, at scale and to the extent you put relationships and maybe in your own community, into your clients, um, that really matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like you, uh, you feel. Like you\'re letting people down if, if you can\'t, so, and I don\'t, I think they\'re at a point of scale. No one cares anymore. Right. They don\'t care. A big conglomerate, like you\'re not a successful</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> number. The customer service, this is always what I think about, and I\'m sure I\'ve shared this once or twice before where I don\'t wanna interact with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers or people like this. I have my friends and I have my personal world where I wanna interact with humans, but on the internet there\'s too many sketchy people out there. So to me, one big goal was to keep customer service as minimal. And what\'s the opposite of hostile? Um, peaceful . As [00:27:00] nourishing as possible to me being an open source maintainer for, I dunno, 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>18 years maybe. Mm-hmm. started with like half a mint back in the day, if anybody remembers that. Yeah, I do. Only the old people and Sean Inman, Iam, I dunno what his name is, but, um, you know, this analytics software, being an open source maintainer for so long, I, I saw the progression. Maybe I\'m so jaded now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe the internet has changed and there\'s more people now I\'m not. But back in the day, it was really pleasant to interact with users of my software that I wanted to write and publish for free. And over the years I just saw that it\'s more, not more and more, but the percentage of shitty and hostile and interactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t know if I can curse on this podcast here. Um, I think just the F word probably, maybe I\'ll refrain from using it became. It\'s more [00:28:00] unpleasant to me. And with object aspro, I wanted to have the same thing where I, I make a software, people pay me for the service every month to use the best of the best, but they didn\'t talk to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was my, my goal. And instead of keeping them away and not responding to customer service requests, I wanted to create software that is so stupid, reliable that they don\'t have to talk to me and bring back everything I learned from my many years in the Laville community. Bring this back. Test driven development, reliability as a, as.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number one core value of, of the software, not performance, not all the fancy belts and whistles and, and cool designs, not reliability, just you install it and you don\'t have to think about it because it just works. If there\'s an error, it recovers by itself. That was the intention because I don\'t wanna do customer service as my, my, my life, and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I could scale and hire people, but I know why have a whole customer service team, What if the [00:29:00] software just works? And right now it\'s slowly changing over the last, let\'s say, I think it\'s almost three years now in ste, in November, um, two and a half years, let\'s say the majority of my days is I work, I do whatever I want, I can, I can drive my businesses forward, whether it\'s the sales and marketing or whether it\'s software and I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have been doing five minutes of customer service so far, and now it\'s slowly getting to like 10 minutes a day, which is still delightful to me, but it\'s 10 minutes now. I\'m not stoked about it, so I\'m working on making all these questions that over and over ask, and in the customer service chat or emails I integrate into the software, so I wanna bring it down to five minutes by just making it more intuitive, more reliable, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Explan explanatory. Explanatory. Kind of like the apple iPhone where you, it just works for the most part, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Some, I, I can, I can hear people, I, I can read minds of [00:30:00] like, you know, you, you\'re talking on the one hand of like putting yourself out of business almost. But on the other hand, I can also imagine a lot of WordPress plug-in developers and, and far beyond that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 minutes. 10 minutes a day. One guy on support. That\'s, that\'s like paradise . Yeah. Cause the, the, the, for years and years and, and ongoing, the, the, probably the single most common, um, uh, complaint and, and it\'s more than a complaint. It\'s a life. It\'s a quality of life. Mm-hmm. issue when you listen to developers and product owners with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a support desk and it\'s, it\'s where the highest frustrations are and where they end up spending its money, time, and, and your mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> Mm-hmm. . So, and to me it\'s, my personally till this thing here, it\'s my happiness, my, [00:31:00] my contentment, and how I feel about life. Doing a lot of customer service is not part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Uh, to be honest, both sides of that transaction don\'t really want to be in there. It\'s not, um, it\'s not where we wanna spend our time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> Yeah. And if it\'s five minutes a day, I can put in the energy. I can be quite nice and helpful. But if it would be 2030, if it\'s an hour, and like this is what I gotta do if I wake up and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a coffee and new customer. So it\'s just, I don\'t wanna do it. I would probably sell the business to Digital Ocean and, and move on. It\'s, that\'s not the life that I wanna live. Right. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> What, what allowed you to, to know that about yourself earlier on? So that just seems unusual. What, what takes you down that, that path of knowing your limitations and know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you want when it\'s the opposite of what everything else says, like go and grow. This is a form of growth, but it\'s not the [00:32:00] stereotype, the one we always think about of bigger, more people, more tickets that come with our support tickets. Mm-hmm. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> What? Think. Think what\'s? I think, I think the Ansys iowaska, psychedelic substances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you call them? plant medicines, if you wanna say. I think that\'s the answer. It could also be just I, because I\'m near atypical, I have to do things my way. Maybe that\'s it. But I definitely, as a human, I value introspection and self inquiry. It\'s top of my list of things that I like to do in life and with myself and what drives me and what I find interesting in myself and understanding how do I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How to still function and how do other people work, which is a lot more challenging sometimes because there\'s someone that can be so irrational and self inquiry and [00:33:00] psychedelics allows me to. Or has allowed me to just be more self-aware than I was five years ago, 10 years ago, and just increase that. If that\'s a quantifiable number, which I don\'t, maybe it isn\'t, get to know myself more of like what makes me happy, what makes me, what helps me be content, or what nourishes me, What drains me, and being self-aware I am, I\'m a huge fan of that, that self inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, there\'s no, if you don\'t leave any room for it, it\'s, it\'s gone. And that time is gone. I, I feel you on that. Um, yeah. The last five years have probably, for almost everyone, have been possibly the toughest, um, in our lives. I, I think that\'s probably not that unique. And a big part of it for me is, um, along with, with remote relationships and remote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and social isolation happening at the same [00:34:00] time that there\'s, um, it\'s been a complicated, um, situation to keep enough of your own head space and relationships and, and things like that, um, that are, that are closer to home. That, you know, traditionally we find our identity and grounding and meaning and, um, Yeah, it\'s just gotten so much harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it sounds like you\'ve kind of gone the, the opposite, opposite direction. Pretty successfully with, with that, ironically, by, as, as other people scale up and develop all these inefficiencies, here\'s this guy with this, with this product that solves that problem to some extent, remaining this kind of calm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Center of the wheel , it\'s like I\'m imagining the, the nun, everything else spinning around and you\'re trying to [00:35:00] do as few, uh, as little, as little movement within the center of that as as possible. Um, seems like a smart, desirable way to work. To me, um, it</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> wasn\'t,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Have you changed, has anything changed in, in your practices, in, in models or is this pretty confirmed at, at this point, this is how you want to do it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re, it sounds like you\'re entertaining some idea of business partners. You know, as long as you have a, a role that allows, allows you to, to have the, the space and, and activity that you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> I think it\'s, um, it\'s a good question. I dunno if I have an answered this. Um, I,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>because it\'s such a loud voice on the outside, everybody does the same thing. This is how you speak, this is how you [00:36:00] behave. This, there\'s so much conformity and we all wanna do this. As you know, talking apes. Because this, It\'s such a reinforcement. I think it\'s called something cultural head. Gem. Gem. Gem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. That\'s the word. Yeah. This is my ESL coming out here. Where it\'s over and over reinforced that it\'s good to be efficient. As a German, this is, I relate to this a lot, but um, it\'s, efficiency is important. Work is important. First question is, what do you do? Like everything is so work centric that it\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes hard to put aside. So I still entertained the thought of like, Hmm, can I do this my way again, , Can I do this in a way that works for me? Can I be efficient or can I support growth my way? It\'s hard to just shut it out because it\'s so dominant in all of, at least the societies that I live in and [00:37:00] the circuits that I live in where money and success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are you doing within like that, the values are just so reinforced externally. That to me to again, find, I\'m gonna quote Joshua Strayer again here. Like, what do I actually wanna do with my life? Um, not that he\'s the first question you ever asked me that, but how do, what do I want? And, and, and forgetting my inner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes happens, and maybe those are the moments that I think about growth and investment. Yeah. And, and scaling out. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I definitely see to, to switch gears here as well, I definitely see being, working with hosting companies the last couple of years, maybe the last years last year more and. I can make a bigger impact in the workforce community if I would have proper backing and, and, [00:38:00] uh, better team. And seeing now working on this particular product for the last close to three years or three years, probably with the development cycle, I\'m really good at product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m good at figuring out with people need. In my five minutes of customer service, I get enough information figuring out what they need. Being technical enough to bridge the gap and, and creating quality products. That\'s kind of the, the pride or that\'s what I\'m proud of or take pride in. And I, in an idea world, I\'d love to focus on that and not think about receipts and my.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accounting balances and all these other things. I try to outsource these things, but there\'s so much more to a business, so much more including customer service. Just focusing on product would be, I think, a very idea idyllic state for me to be in, of just, I get to just [00:39:00] create and make the world a better place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, less resource usage, faster, low times, less electricity being used and. Less headaches for people like the, the emotional impact of people worrying about the WordPress websites. That to me is a un quantifiable number that I really like to get higher. Um, why worry about your software? Like, let\'s worry about the relationships that we have or the what we want maybe, um, our ourselves and like these, the things that actually matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with software is making the lives a bit easier and less annoying. Um, I\'d love to do that. Back to your question of like, has anything changed? Just more and more discovering, running all of this myself and then outsourcing some engineering parts or the, you know, accounting, bookkeeping. Obviously it would be fun to just do product itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it\'s not [00:40:00] my reality at the moment, but I would entertain it if it\'s, if it\'s done right. And I\'ve heard this a few times, whether this is the Pagely acquisition or WP Media, the WP Rocket guys, there seems to be companies out there that are still have a lot of financial backing, but they\'re not,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I don\'t know how to say this. They\'re not cutthroat capitalists. Right machines. Good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> disadvantage maybe, but worth life. Worth living.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> Yeah. Like the, the one group one or one group. Mm-hmm. one.com hosting. And in Scandinavia, they just seem to, maybe it\'s a Scandinavian model. Again, just more focus on Yeah, we all work, we all pick pride in that maybe or identify with what we do for, for, for work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not at the extreme expense of our personal lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. [00:41:00] I, I think who\'s gonna argue with that? and feel good, feel like they really mean it. But yeah, that is a, it does seem more and more like that\'s a, a culture and the spirit and ethos that\'s, that\'s been diminished over time. Mm-hmm. in open source and Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It needs, it needs advocates in</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> it\'s, Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> it\'s a, it\'s good to have voices for that, but there\'s also some really practical things to it. Some of what you were saying, I, I know you, um, if you wanna drive down headaches and inefficiencies and stuff that doesn\'t work and poor quality products, testing is probably your main answer to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For practically speaking, what can WordPress do to. take, take a lot of trouble off of, off of, um, individual shoulders and off, you know, off the project, I [00:42:00] suppose too. Is that, is that accurate that the, the role of testing and standards, um, are an area that we\'re, we</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> haven\'t, um, yeah. Really matured in? I think so, and I\'m still , I still dislike it, um, but I do it because it\'s, I wanna push a big release on a Friday afternoon and go camping for the weekend without having to worry about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'ve done this a few times now, like I try to release on a Friday afternoon and push big releases to, I don\'t know what, it\'s like 400,000 sites now. Um, Test driven development, whether this is, yeah, whether this is test driven development, meaning first you write your tests and then you write the software, or if you do it after the fact and you spend the extra, you know, 30% I think it is on, on average.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, The extra time to write tests, get to, you don\'t have to chase the [00:43:00] 100% code coverage where every single line is tested, but at least test the major parts of your software and whether this is JavaScript browser integration testing, and when you click this button, something happens and it works. Or this is just following the, the paths and PHP of like when.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens when you flush the cash by cli? Does it actually empty your red estate? Just having sanity checks in place? It\'s a very technical topic. Testing in general, there\'s, what\'s his name? Um, Chris Hard, The grumpy programmer, who is just his whole life seems to be an advocate for testing, um, in, in many, many different communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not exclusive to php, just test your software. And to me, that allows me to be confident in what I. To trust my own software cuz I\'m very flawed and make mistakes all the time. But my tests will tell me when I do and just have peace of mind over the weekend where I [00:44:00] can, I don\'t have to stress out about pushing out a release that might break other people\'s sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this has been a very frequent occurrence. And WordPress, anybody from, I\'m not gonna say any names, but I\'m sure we all write the stories that as a release and sudden. I don\'t know. Millions of websites are slower because there\'s no tests, so there\'s no quality. Qa, What\'s it called? Quality assurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quality qa. Qa, Yeah. There\'s no teams. And whether this is manual or I think it should be automated because why spend human hours trying to do this? Just take the time to write these test. It\'s. It helps me. And then also to this extent of like customers have, I think more trust in the software. When there\'s releases and there\'s no, Oh, buck fix is, Buck fix is buck fixes and many small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the the evolution of my free plugin, the Reddest object Cash. Sometimes when I do a big release, they do six [00:45:00] releases and 24 hours. It\'s so many people using it and something breaks for someone. And this is what I wanted to do different with Object Cash Pro. It\'s written from the ground up and it\'s test driven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like there is no, it\'s not, not quite a hundred percent quote coverage at this point, but it\'s a very, It\'s thoroughly tested. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. And what\'s the barrier to that? Becoming more of the. in WordPress are, are you involved in the on the core test team at all? I know you do. Uhfor the new</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> performance team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I\'m not. I see that there is a lot of tests in WordPress core, like it\'s well tested. I think the, not the theme market, but the plugin market itself seems are probably a pain to test the plugin. Industry plugin. Severe is, testing is not a common thing. I, I don\'t see it very much. No few people seem to even talk about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t wanna be an [00:46:00] advocate for it. I have other things to do. Maybe I should do a presentation at some point at a conference just to like see the, So the seats, what do you call? Put the seats in the ground. Yeah. Yeah. It\'s, uh, it\'s really good. I don\'t know if there\'s anything in the way except for awareness and then actually taking the time to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It, it, it\'s time consuming. It\'s expensive. If it\'s 30% of the time that you write code, that if it\'s an hour, I don\'t know what 30% is, 20 minutes, 80 minutes, something like that. A third, let\'s say, of that time coding. , you would then spend writing tests. It\'s not fun. I, I don\'t, You can make it kind of fun with like a decent test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We, a nice tooling, but it\'s still, you, you, you\'re doing this. However, for me, now down the road, seeing that I have three years of. Software in one place. I don\'t wanna test all these pieces that have written a year ago. They work, they can just stay [00:47:00] as they are, and if they break, I will know down the road and they can actually move a bit faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, in the future of like whether this is adding new features or changing how timeouts work. The last release I pushed yesterday was adding connection retries and the few things broke and I, I just know I don\'t have. Abuse . I don\'t have to abuse my customers and they test it on their life production sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My tests will reveal these issues first, which I, I think it\'s the more customer friendly approach to not let your customers test your software. And, um, I listen to the Accidental Tech podcast the other day where Apple kind of dust is at scale. They just throw it out. Developers do the QA for them. I think that was the comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can\'t speak to that, but it reminds me of this talking about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, very much so. Yeah. Do you, do you think that that, um, WordPress is, you could say relative [00:48:00] isolation or under participation in the larger PHP world is part of the story too, that if, if there was more overlap and more. Mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relationships in, into, into things like Elle or a Million Possible Directions with, with PHP and is more, more directly involved with it. That, that, that would help, uh, that would enhance some things like, like stand uh, standards around testing and and so on. Um, we just kind of, our ecosystem and people do their own thing cause it\'s, they\'re not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re not, um, their peers are in a, in a different place than, say, someone working in, in a, a PHP framework somewhere</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> else. Yeah. I think there\'s, I mean, there\'s a lot of smart developers on WordPress as well that\'s maybe [00:49:00] cross to, to the other. Ecosystems over outside of WordPress and they include testing, whether this is Google engineers being hired or whatever it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is, there is good tooling out there. I don\'t think we\'re too isolated. We definitely judge and look down upon, um, understandably so. Maybe that\'s just because of the lack of testing, but I, I don\'t even know how to solve this. To me it\'s a problem and maybe it would be enforcing tests for plugins with more than, I don\'t know, a thousand users on the repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you can measure OB objectively. You can quantify the code coverage, whether let\'s say it\'s 80% what, whatever\'s a reasonable or 50%. , I dunno if you can have the main path. I, I, I don\'t know the, the details of this, but you could also enforce it such as like, Hey, you\'ve got now 12 months to test your software, and then it gets a little check mark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey, [00:50:00] this plugin has a test suite. I would need to build one for my free plugin. Now , But it, it might be a good, good idea and to include in that there\'s been a. Talk in deep What Core Performance? Performance Core, I don\'t know. They just changed the name, The performance team. Mm-hmm. , Um, to have, whether there\'s this badges that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have a clean, what percent stall you install a plugin. How do the, my queries, like what\'s the impact of this plugin? How is performance being handled? And I dunno how much you can automate these tests, but maybe we need more reviewers that there is more high quality code a. On the wordpress.org, at least for the ones that have, um, you know, a hundred thousand, a million users that you know that these are actually properly tested for performance degradations or recessions, um, regressions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry, so many recessions going on at the moment, and for [00:51:00] performance regressions or just for testing, I think that would be a decent approach. I don\'t know if this is feasible. Someone, what\'s her? Epstein, she something. Half Elf is on a Twitter profile. I don\'t, Yeah. You know what I\'m talking about. Yes. Um.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She, I think, runs the plugin team and I don\'t know what of the, what is possible and it\'s of course it\'s a big burden. Again, on that you, we push on open source developers and maybe there needs to be fun. I don\'t know how to solve this problem, but testing would definitely improve the overall trust in WordPress, that you can upgrade a plugin without things going slow or breaking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it would be a good approach and. I would say it\'s certainly part of the secret sauce for Object Cash Pro and its success. It just, you can trust that it\'s reliable. Yeah. And business is first. Well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> as an alternative to putting it on on.org, there\'s always the possibility I\'ve wondered about this, like why the, I\'m not aware of this happening, but [00:52:00] in a maturing market and ecosystem that I think we do have, there\'s the possibility of industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>cooperation and self-regulation to some extent, where you, those larger plugin, um, companies could on their own, see the, see that value and decide on a standard amongst themselves some common tooling or, or practice or something like that and do their part to kind of police that end of the, the market or set an example that, that sounds like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very strong policing, but I mean you\'re, you know, pleasing bugs. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> oh, we already have guidelines for the plugins, what you can and can\'t do. Yeah, it\'s very clear and they all make sense. Maybe adding performance and test coverage to that could be at least a discussion. I\'m sure it has been. I will talk to Felix at work, us about this on the country today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Good. That\'s, uh, yeah, that\'s definitely a, a [00:53:00] progressive direction to, to move in. Um, where, where do you see, um, opportunities and, you know, for, for you and, and just WordPress in general, where are they, where are the opportunities and I guess the, the risks and, and threats. People would often seem to have more of those in mind, but, um, how those two relative quantities is they\'re, Which is more on your mind and, and what are you, what are you seeing down the road?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> probably with everybody. I\'m more, I think more about the risks. Yeah. And threat than the opportunities. The monkey brand. Mm-hmm. , I don\'t know if an answer to, if I have an answer to this, I, some of them are a bit concerned of like, how long is WordPress around? , but it doesn\'t, it\'s not slowing. Maybe this is just like you said, the talking apr, [00:54:00] I, it\'s not slowing down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s acquisitions everywhere. I don\'t see it dying out for whatever reason. All the replacements like it\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess, yeah, I don\'t know. I, I, I don\'t, I don\'t think I have an answer to that question. Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> That\'s fine. It\'s a big, big, wide open one. Um, I, I think a lot of, a lot of things you, you\'ve touched on, I wish I, you know, we, we hear more, and I, I hope resonates with, uh, a lot of people. We don\'t often connect the human social embeddedness of our lives with the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re doing or not openly or we don\'t share that and, you know, why else are you doing what you do? Um, some people are pretty open about it, but, um, I would, I would like to hope that there\'s, there\'s opportunity in this space for people who wanna work that way, who are wanna work like you [00:55:00] do, and that this is, this is a good model that however big everything else may get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s those cracks, like you said, between. The sidewalk where there\'s room for a relatively low stress. Good, good work. Um, and</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> I\'m glad you found that. If there\'s any more questions, if, if you like listening to this, if you enjoy the, the, this conversation, the stories, if there\'s anything the listeners want to hear more about or any questions, I\'m always happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can hit me up on Slack, on post status, Slack for of course, WordPress, Slack email. You know, or send questions to Dan and we can do, uh, if there\'s the demand for it. Uh, episode two on this.</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 13:15:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress – September 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13596\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/the-month-in-wordpress-september-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14922:\"<p>September was an exciting month with the return of many in-person WordCamps, WordPress Translation Day, and preparations for WordPress 6.1.

Automattic-sponsored contributor Aaron Robertshaw published a video, illustrating how the block editor now supports  dropping an image onto an empty paragraph block to replace it with a new Image block.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The site editor has also added drag-and-drop capabilities for blocks and patterns in the new zoomed-out view, which was added in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-14-1-improves-navigation-block-adds-experimental-zoomed-out-view\">Gutenberg version 14.1</a>. It zooms out to focus on building and composing patterns, allowing users to move sections around without affecting the inner blocks. It can be enabled under &#8220;Experiments.&#8221; In 14.3, users can drag blocks and patterns right onto the canvas with an overhead view that makes it easy to place in between existing blocks.</p>\n\n\n\nvideo source: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44402\">Gutenberg PR #44402</a>\n\n\n\n<p>This version also introduces new support for alt + arrow keyboard combinations for navigating blocks. Robertshaw explained how they work:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>For example, if your cursor is towards the end of a long paragraph, you can quickly press <code>alt + up arrow</code> to move to the beginning of that paragraph. If you are already at the beginning of a text block, you’ll move to the start of the previous paragraph. Similarly, <code>alt + down arrow</code> will move you to the end of a block of text.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Styles typography controls have been updated to include the Tools Panels that users have available in the Block Settings interface. This makes the experience more consistent and expands the capabilities to allow for resetting the values.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes dozens of fixes and improvements to design tools, components, the Block API, and more. Check out the changelog in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/13/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-3-12-october/\">announcement post</a> for the full list of updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 14.3 will not be included in the upcoming WordPress 6.1 release but will be rolled into core the next time around.

I recorded this conversation with Till back in August, and it\'s about time we pushed it out.

There\'s likely a lot of opportunity in aligning on performance as a key, common interest for product, agency, and hosting companies in the WordPress space. <em>And</em>, as Till\'s example shows, a small WordPress company, or company of one that wants to stay that way, still can thrive today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper\">Till\'s particular niche is not for everyone, but some of his ideas are very portable. For one thing, what plugin owner has not felt the pain of an extraordinarily busy support forum? Till is up to (wait for it..) 5-10 <em>minutes</em> a day on support — which he aims to decrease. How? Testing to ensure the highest quality. It\'s an idea that needs to become a reality and a habit in the third party WordPress product ecosystem, Till insists — and I think he\'s right about that and much else. </p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 20:55:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Shortcodes Ultimate Plugin Patches CSRF Vulnerability in Version 5.12.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=138591\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/shortcodes-ultimate-plugin-patches-csrf-vulnerability-in-version-5-12-1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1375:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcodes-ultimate/\">Shortcodes Ultimate plugin</a>, used on more than 700,000 WordPress sites for creating things like tabs, buttons, and accordions, has patched a vulnerability in version 5.12.1. The plugin&#8217;s changelog simply says, <em>&#8220;This update fixes a security vulnerability in the shortcode generator</em>. To the author&#8217;s credit,  the changelog clearly denotes it as a security update, although it doesn&#8217;t offer specific details. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vulnerability was reported by researcher Dave Jong at Patchstack and is <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-38086\">logged at the National Vulnerability Database</a> (NVD) as a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability leading to plugin preset settings change. It was patched two weeks ago and the NVD published the advisory this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this time, the vulnerability is not known to have been exploited, but users are advised to update to the latest version. Based on WordPress.org <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcodes-ultimate/advanced/\">stats</a>, 46% of the plugin&#8217;s user base is running on versions older than 5.12.x.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the themes, and in this case, why you should be excited about WordPress blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or go to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. You can do that by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the contact form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Nick Diego. Nick is a Developer Advocate at WP Engine. He can be found, creating educational content, building plugins and themes, and contributing to WordPress core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s on the podcast today to talk about his passion and optimism for the future of WordPress using blocks. At the recent WordCamp US, Nick gave a presentation entitled, &#8216;Let&#8217;s build a custom block in 15 minutes&#8217;. It was his attempt at showing a group of WordPress enthusiasts that the barrier to creating blocks is slowly being eroded, due to the creation of new tools. These tools are creating opportunities for people who might otherwise have stayed away from block development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s becoming easier to create the blocks as the tools take away much of the technical burden of getting you up and running without advanced knowledge of JavaScript and React. Coupled with core components, native blocks supports, and a bit of guidance, Nick thinks that every WordPress developer can add custom blocks to their repertoire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s clear that Nick is all in on blocks. And during the podcast, he makes the case for why you should be too. They offer so many opportunities for what can be displayed on a page, and their capabilities are only getting better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about how WordPress core blocks are trying to support developers by adding components and blocks supports so you don&#8217;t have to repeat the development work already done by others. You can build on top of previous work and thereby save yourself valuable time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a fascinating chat, especially for those who are, as yet, undecided about whether they want to embrace WordPress blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically when we record the podcast, there&#8217;s not a lot of background noise, but that&#8217;s not always the case. Over the coming weeks, I&#8217;ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artifacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listenable, I hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes as well. And so without further delay, I bring you Nick Diego.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Nick Diego. How you doing, Nick?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> I&#8217;m doing great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Would you just introduce yourself? Give us a little bit of your background, who you work for. How come you&#8217;re at WordCamp US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:08] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> I&#8217;m a developer advocate at WP Engine. I also do a lot of contributing both on the WordPress core team and also on the training team for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> He&#8217;s doing a talk, presentation. What&#8217;s it all about Nick?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:19] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> It&#8217;s all about trying to get people excited about building their own custom blocks, and I attempted to build a custom block completely in fifteen minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Did you achieve it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:29] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> Just barely. I got the zero minute sign as I was just finishing the presentation, so I just got under the wire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess the principle therefore, is that if you can do something in 15 minutes, I mean, let&#8217;s be honest, you&#8217;re pretty well versed, probably had a few runs through of that. But the bit that you are trying to educate people in, is that it&#8217;s easier now than it ever has been. So there&#8217;s no excuse to not explore. Is that basically it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:50] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> Yeah, and I think building blocks has been a bit scary. I know it was scary for myself. I didn&#8217;t come from a JavaScript background, mainly PHP. And so I wanted to show people that there&#8217;s so many more tools nowadays that it&#8217;s not as scary to get started, and if I can do it in 15 minutes, and I came from a non-technical background. You can do it too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> When blocks came around, Gutenberg was launched the first time, how did we build blocks and how has that changed? What things have come over the horizon since then to make it easier?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:19] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> You wandered in the wilderness and looked for some documentation that maybe didn&#8217;t exist, and maybe looked at some core blocks and you kind of tried to figure it out. But today you can scaffold an entire block with one line of code in your terminal and voila, you have a block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is that because it&#8217;s become easier to do, or is that just that there&#8217;s more documentation? Are there actual tools? Are there pieces of software that you can download and use and things to make it more straightforward?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:46] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> I find building with JavaScript is just inherently more challenging than PHP, but we have tools today written by contributors to WordPress that allow you to take all the hard bits and it takes care of that for you. And you can actually get to building the block itself and not worry about compiling JavaScript files and compiling style sheets. It&#8217;s all kind of done for you, which really makes it a lot easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And when you say done for you, is that literally done for you? There&#8217;s no caveats. You just do the workflow that you&#8217;ve just described and you&#8217;re off to the races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:15] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> It does it all for you. It scaffolds the whole thing. And now there&#8217;s a new version that came out actually like last week that allows you to choose different types of blocks you want to build and it will scaffold that for you and you can get started there, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;ll put the link, which you may mention in a moment in the show notes, but where do we find these tools? Where are we going to be going to? Are there websites that you can mention?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:37] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> So the biggest tool right now is called Create Block, kind of on the nose, but it&#8217;s maintained by the WordPress core contributing community. And it&#8217;s, well, it&#8217;ll be in the show notes, but it&#8217;s just Crate Block, WordPress in Google and you&#8217;ll find it. The documentation&#8217;s being built out. I gotta shout out Ryan Walter, a Developer Advocate at Automattic. He&#8217;s done a lot of work on the Create Block tool, and a lot of the documentation around it. So, that&#8217;s a place to start if you want to use that tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, and does it allow us to do all the things? Does the tool allow us to do a subset of things? In other words, if you are really thick in the weeds and you understand how to do React and all of that, are there limitations or constraints that the tool will not allow you to cross over?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:18] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> So, I&#8217;m a fairly novice React builder and so, and I think most people getting started with blocks would be. But if you&#8217;re a pro user, there are functionality in the tool. You could define like all your own templates. Basically, you can let it do whatever you want it to do. So if your new, it does a lot for you. And if you&#8217;re an expert you can still use it, but then, do all the wizardry that you&#8217;re used to and combine it with the tool to make your life easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So why would we want to use blocks in the first place? I don&#8217;t mean that glibly. I literally mean that, there are blocks that come installed in a vanilla version of WordPress. They achieve the majority of what most people want to publish online. What is the use case? What are the kinds of things that are useful? What kind of things can you create, that you have seen, that you have enjoyed looking at?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:08] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> Assuming that you&#8217;ve bought into the block editor and that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re using and you&#8217;re not using a page builder or something like that, core blocks are great, but they&#8217;re designed to have all sorts of functionality that maybe you want or don&#8217;t want. I was actually talking to an agency earlier at Word Camp US, and they&#8217;re all in on blocks, and most of their blocks are custom because they want to provide specific functionality to their clients that maybe is a little bit different than core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe completely niche blocks for, I don&#8217;t know, food blogging or whatever it might be. All within a block. The block UI that interface where their clients can get in there, see it visually and add the content on their page visually. And then obviously that translates to the front end. So, tons of reasons why you&#8217;d want to make the editing experience more visual. Not only that, but allow you to control more the experience than maybe just using native core blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the principle being if you&#8217;ve got something, I&#8217;m going to guess this is the use case. If you&#8217;ve got something which on a particular project is something that&#8217;s going to be repeated, and in order to do that you would have to otherwise drag in a load of different blocks and sort of scaffold them together. This is the kind of use case. So something like a menu item on a restaurant menu. Or a real estate house listing item. Something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:26] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> Yeah, for example, I know a lot of agencies specialize. We do real estate or hospitality or whatever. You could build your own suite of blocks for your agency and then roll them out to your clients and it&#8217;s very unique. Now there&#8217;s so many third party blocks out there that you can just pull off the shelf that are fantastic, but sometimes you need something custom, and knowing how to build custom blocks I think, whether you need it or not, is a pretty valuable tool to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just give us an idea in the 15 minutes that you had. What was the scope and magnitude of what you were able to create? I&#8217;m guessing, you know it&#8217;s not earth shattering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:57] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> It&#8217;s not. So, most people are probably familiar with the Hello Dolly plugin, by Matt Mullenweg. And so to me, when I first started developing with WordPress, Hello Dolly was like this example of, it&#8217;s one file and it did something sort of novel. Look how easy it is to extend WordPress. And so it actually started, somebody online said, can you make a block that does a random motivational quote?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, oh, that kind of reminds me of Hello Dolly, which has a random lyric from the song. And I&#8217;m like, what if we blockify Hello Dolly, and show just how easy it is to make a block using the original Hello Dolly plugin. That&#8217;s what I did. I made a block that spits out a random lyric from Hello Dolly on the front end of your site. We basically copy and pasted all of Matt&#8217;s original functions from Hello Dolly, dumped it into a block, and it just works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So imagine that I&#8217;ve got an agency and we have never touched this before. Realistically, how easy is it for you to push your team over to this kind of methodology? Are we talking days, weeks months, possibly years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:59] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> Well, I think it depends on what you&#8217;re trying to build. So the thing that I built in the presentation was a dynamic block, where the front end&#8217;s all rendered in PHP. So if you&#8217;re really familiar with PHP and you don&#8217;t want to mess with very much JavaScript, you could create a dynamic block where you create some very simple interface in the editor, but then on the front end can do really complicated PHP stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s many ways like, I hate to use this term, but it&#8217;s kind of like a short code in many ways. You, you have an interface in the editor, which people play with. Not just a short code, but then on the front end, just whatever PHP you want, and that&#8217;s what basically what we built. If you&#8217;re looking to get started quickly, that&#8217;s not very challenging. I mean, using the tool plus your own knowledge of PHP, getting started that way is not too bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In terms of building these things, the scenario that I just gave you was an agency. We&#8217;re using our own employees to build the blocks to service our clients. Do you feel that in the future there&#8217;s going to be, in much the same way that there is for plugins at the moment. You can, you know, you can really make a decent living if you have a popular plugin. Do you feel like the same is possible for blocks? And I don&#8217;t mean like a suite of blocks, like, for example the real estate one. Could you potentially create a block and then have a marketplace to sell it, and make a decent living? Because I feel that&#8217;s where the next shift in revenue streams for WordPress might .Be</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:16] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> I hope so. I think that it kind of speaks to the broader question of the WordPress economy and ecosystem, and we&#8217;re starting to see a lot of consolidation and all that kind of stuff. But I do think that there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity around blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know I have my own personal blocks. They&#8217;re all free, but they&#8217;re starting to get like a lot of usage, in the multiple thousands of active users. And it&#8217;s really only started in the last year where it&#8217;s like, okay, I guess blocks are a thing, we should adopt them. People are starting to use it more and I think that it&#8217;s an opportunity to stake out your niche and you know, if you&#8217;re really knowledgeable about real estate or whatever it might be. Yeah, build blocks and I&#8217;m sure people want to use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What are the blocks that you&#8217;ve built?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:55] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> So I&#8217;ve built one that adds SVG icons to the editor and you can make them colorful and move them around. And then one&#8217;s a social sharing block. Really simple, just allows you to share the current page or post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And they&#8217;re getting traction, yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:09] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> My SVG icon one, which is just. Also, one thing, if you&#8217;re building blocks, it&#8217;s very much like there&#8217;s not many people doing it. So you can really get great block names. So I have a block called The Icon Block, right. It wasn&#8217;t taken, so it&#8217;s the icon block, and it just allows you to edit SVG icons. And, I looked the other day and it&#8217;s got 4,000 people using it. And I&#8217;m like, how is this happening?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I kind of feel that the tide has gone, if you like for getting notoriety in plug-ins. I mean, sure, there are some that come along and for reasons that I can&#8217;t quite explain, they rise to the top quickly. They get some notoriety. But it sounds from what you&#8217;re saying as if, we&#8217;re just sort of landing on the beach really, and the beach head is yet to be taken. And if you get in now and develop now, you could be in that next wave and be what popular plug-ins are now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:53] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> Yeah, it could be. We&#8217;ll see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. You used the word accessible. Now forgive me because I&#8217;ve completely misquoted you. You used the word accessible in your introduction. You were just talking about accessible in the sense of easy to use. But I am curious because I was interviewing somebody yesterday all about accessibility in WordPress, and we got into the interface and blocks and all of that kind of thing. So just a quick aside, the accessibility piece in blocks. Have you got anything to add in there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:19] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> I think that accessibility in the block editor is something that continually needs improvement. And so one of the things, and I think we&#8217;ll talk about this in a second, is that when you&#8217;re building a custom block, the more that you can take advantage of the way that core does things. So core block supports, and we&#8217;ll talk about that, but the more you can take advantage of core components and things like that, the better off you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because there&#8217;s a big emphasis on WordPress to improve accessibility. So if your block is using components from core, and core improves accessibility, your block will therefore also be more accessible. So instead of trying to do your own thing and code everything yourself. One, that&#8217;s harder. And two, you&#8217;re able to keep up with accessibility and all these other improvements by really staying close to core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;re talking there about an evolution over time and I really haven&#8217;t followed the trajectory of what blocks could do in the beginning and what they can do now. Is there a lot of change that&#8217;s happened over the last couple of years? The capabilities of a block, am I able to do much more now? Obviously we&#8217;re talking about how easy it is, but am I able to do more with blocks than I was, let&#8217;s say two years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:31] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> I don&#8217;t think necessarily that you could do more now, because you could always, if you were really skilled, you could always just write whatever you wanted. But a great example is block support. So block supports are when you create your block, you can define, I want my block to have typography support, or I want my block to have color support. It&#8217;s one line. Instead of having to write all the controls in a color palette and all the functionality, you just tell WordPress that this block has typography.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your block loads in the editor and it has all the typography controls already. And those are coming from core. You&#8217;re not having to code any of that. You just tell, my block has typography, and it gives it to you. And so if WordPress ever improves their typography controls, your block already gets those improved controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So is it easier now? Can blocks do more? You can do more in blocks without having to code it yourself. You can do color, alignment, border, background colors, typography. All this stuff, you don&#8217;t have to code it all. You just tell WordPress that my block has this functionality and you&#8217;re good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Are there any sort of gaping holes in all of this? In other words, if you Nick were in charge of the roadmap for what blocks would do, is there anything that you feel, do you know what It would be nice to have this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:41] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> I think that, I&#8217;m actually quite happy where things are, but I do think that we continually need better examples, more resources, because it&#8217;s still brand new. And one of the things I was actually talking to folks at the conference today, You may have been working in WordPress for 10 years and you have all this knowledge about how to build with WordPress. Unfortunately, that does not translate to building with blocks. Blocks is brand new. It&#8217;s completely different. It&#8217;s hard when you&#8217;re running a business to dedicate time to learn something new and it&#8217;s, that costs money. Time is money. And so the more that we can do to create examples, build tools that help people get quicker, the more adoption that we&#8217;ll have and, we&#8217;ll be better in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You come to these events and obviously you&#8217;ve got your block hat on. You have had for several years or certainly as long as I&#8217;ve been acquainted with you Do you find the conversation is more and more turning to blocks? In other words, there&#8217;s 600 people here. I don&#8217;t know how many of them would class themselves as developers, or capable or wishing to build blocks. But three or four years ago, I&#8217;m imagining that the conversation around blocks was basically Nick talking to himself. Is that changing? Are people more and more beginning to use this as the mode to create in WordPress</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:48] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> I fundamentally believe that we&#8217;ll get to a point where people either use a page builder like Elementor or whatever, that they&#8217;re really comfortable with, or they&#8217;ll use blocks. Core blocks or you build with a page builder. I think we&#8217;re going to get to that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And do you see that there&#8217;s a sort of conflict there? Do you do you see that there would be a point where. So we&#8217;ve got two paths in that scenario. You&#8217;ve got like a proprietary page builder. You mentioned Elementor, there&#8217;s lots of others. And then you&#8217;ve got blocks and obviously they go in completely different directions. Do you think that&#8217;s healthy? Is that a good thing? Or would it be, would it be better to sort of try to get them to coalesce in some way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have no idea what that would even look like, because they are very different animals. But I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a good thing to have almost like two, two variants of WordPress, and in 10 years time, you can imagine a crowd over there who are barely able to speak to the crowd over here. I don&#8217;t mean an impolite, but you know, they&#8217;re just talking complete cross purposes. The block chatter over here is incompatible with the page builder chatter over there. And that feels, in a way, like that would be a shame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:45] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> It definitely would be, but I do think that page builders, this is my own interpretation, but page builders were a response to the fact that it was fairly hard to build in the classic editor. So they were going to build a page builder experience that helped people build easier, and it&#8217;s multimillion dollar companies now running these page builders. I know people who are Elementor builders and that&#8217;s great. I mean, they found their niche and they build everything with Elementor, and it looks very different from core WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that build process is completely different. I think we are going to end up with different camps. But as long as both communities are thriving and like, you know, everything is still compatible. We&#8217;re a big community and I think it can support different areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, we can definitely have both. Okay, give us some examples, some concrete examples, of things that you&#8217;ve seen out in the wild of blocks where you&#8217;ve thought that&#8217;s ingenious, that&#8217;s a really impressive use of it. There may be one, there may be a couple. You can name names and I&#8217;ll try to dig out the URL if I can find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:40] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> So one of the things that I saw recently, which I don&#8217;t think this is released yet, but I&#8217;m forgetting the name of the technology where you can type in a prompt, and AI will generate an image for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Things like DALL-E.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:52] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> Exactly. So there&#8217;s a gentleman, I&#8217;m forgetting his name. He&#8217;s working on a block that can do that all within the WordPress editor. So you can just type in whatever and it generates your four images and you pick the one you want. Automatically inserts it into the page. It&#8217;s all like super seamless, and that&#8217;s just amazing. We&#8217;ll save it to your media library. You can insert it, set it as your featured image. So all within the editor as a block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think that&#8217;s the piece which I find most exciting about blocks, is that if you&#8217;re just using core WordPress and the small collection of blocks that comes with it, you just sort of see them as an interface to add images, add text, maybe, you know, add some background color or what have you. But I kind of see this future where the block becomes like an application. It can do a whole ton of heavy lifting, but all you need to do on the back end as a user of that block is basically to click it, and then it comes and you can move it around on the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The complexity that could drop into there, just in that one tiny little block which you just click, is almost infinite in scale. And so that&#8217;s a really great implementation of that. You click a button and suddenly that whole DALL-E thing is dropped into your, your website. Yeah That&#8217;s amazing. Any other examples?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:05] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> Well, I think that there&#8217;s another one about like Anthony Burchell, he works at WP Engine as well. He&#8217;s building one that does virtual reality and metaverse stuff, really complicated. I build blocks that are super simple. Add icons, social sharing links or whatever. So you can build something really simple, but it&#8217;s all JavaScript. So you could also build something really complicated. And I think that that&#8217;s the beauty of the block interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned in your introduction, this is something I think we&#8217;ll explore a little bit more. You use the words, core components, native block support, and honestly at that point I was, I don&#8217;t even know what Nick is talking about. Explain all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:39] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> Block support is a little bit what I was talking about before with defining that your block, I want my block to have typography controls. I want my block to have color controls. There&#8217;s a set of defined supports within WordPress. I&#8217;m going to not get them all, but it&#8217;s like alignment, color, typography, border. There&#8217;s probably a few more. And all of those you can just define and WordPress will add all the controls for you all within the interface. So you don&#8217;t have to do anything other than say that my block has these supports. It really speeds up development time. You don&#8217;t have to build a color picker, build typography, selectors, anything. It&#8217;s all in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Core components are similar, where if you had a block and it had, you clicked on it, so it had like a toolbar that people could select items from, maybe change italicized font or whatever. There&#8217;s a toolbar component within WordPress, so rather than creating your own toolbar architecture, you just say use the toolbar component from WordPress, and then define the tools that you want in the toolbar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So using core supports really will speed up development, but on top of that, you&#8217;re using the same interface that WordPress is using. So from a user, it all feels very native. It&#8217;s the same looking toolbar that you get on your standard paragraph block or whatever it might be. And the beauty is, whenever WordPress updates or improves their toolbar control or their block, supports, your block will already get that improvement. You don&#8217;t have to worry about updating things yourself. It&#8217;s already, because you&#8217;re using WordPress core components and supports, when WordPress gets better, your block will automatically get better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned Hello Dolly earlier, you know, one of the, if not the first plugin and it heralded an era of enormous change in WordPress, and all of a sudden you go 10 years later on and there&#8217;s loads of different plugins available. And you get this notion that, okay, enough now. You&#8217;ve got 50 plugins on your website, it&#8217;s probably time to think about the resources that you&#8217;re using and trimming that down a little bit. Do you fear the same may happen with WordPress websites, where we just click happy and install like a million blocks, because we want everything possible in the website. Is there a danger of bloat, just overdoing it with blocks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:49] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> A hundred percent. I think that you can have a block for everything and end up with a hundred blocks on your website. A hundred third party blocks in your website. It&#8217;s like, wow, there&#8217;s a lot of blocks. But at the same time, I think that, I was looking at a website of a user who needed some help and I opened it up and there&#8217;s a hundred plugins and notifications all over the place. You know, it&#8217;s just an absolute mess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think with WordPress, you always can kind of mess, not mess it up, but you always can like over install. But I think that with blocks you can run into the same problem, but if you can stick to core as closely as possible. And hopefully core will get better and better, and so that you don&#8217;t need third party blocks to do simple things like buttons, let core take care of the simple stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you focus on third party blocks that do very niche things, things that core will never do. You&#8217;re thoughtful about it. You can probably pare it down to, you know, a handful of third party blocks that you actually need on your site. But yeah, there&#8217;s a good chance that we&#8217;re going to have sites with hundreds of blocks that maybe people never use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why like I never wanted to disparage a block library plugin. Cause I think they&#8217;re really useful and help people get started. But most of the time you don&#8217;t need &#8217;em all. You only need a couple, but you install the block library that has 25, 30. So I like the idea of single block plugins where you can, I actually need this and I&#8217;m going to install it. I&#8217;m not going to install a hundred.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s going to be a really interesting thing for agencies because they&#8217;re going to be the people working out, which are the, the necessary blocks that they want their agency to use. So you&#8217;ve just described block suites, where 50 or a hundred come along for the ride and 99% of them you&#8217;re never going to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That will become a core skill, is knowing, in the same way that you&#8217;ve got your favorite contact form plug in now and you&#8217;ve got your favorite whatever. I&#8217;m imagining that there&#8217;ll be a day where, we&#8217;ve all got our little list of, these are the suite of blocks that I&#8217;m using and I don&#8217;t stray outside of those. And that feels like an area of expertise that we can bring to clients just to make their lives a little bit easier. We know what to install for them because we&#8217;ve done it a thousand times before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:48] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> And I also think it&#8217;s going to be very important for agencies to remove blocks. Core has a ton of blocks, all the embed blocks. You could just have a default little script that strips &#8217;em all out and just has the very basics that people actually need. So we want to be adding blocks, but in many cases you also want to be removing them. The ones that you don&#8217;t need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Did you ever come across a proposal by a chap called Joel Spolsky? I believe he was behind Trello possibly. I could be wrong, but anyway, he&#8217;s a, he&#8217;s got a heritage of doing things well in tech and implementing great applications. You came up with this notion of the block protocol and the idea behind the block protocol was that a block here in Trello would be able to be interoperable with a block over here, WordPress. Equally, you know, if you&#8217;ve got gmail working, the blocks in Gmail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s pie in the sky stuff at the moment. It&#8217;s just an idea. But I read the proposal, I just thought it was really compelling. I love, I mean, especially in open source. I can imagine companies, proprietary software companies, they might be a little reluctant to do this because their secret source is the fact that their code is, you know, is obfuscated and we don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing. But I do love the idea of that, and I was curious what your thoughts were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:00] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> I think it&#8217;s fascinating and I also think, we talked a little bit about block supports, where instead of every plugin registering a different way to do typography or a different way to do color, by standardizing the way different common controls are used in blocks. You can get towards something like this, where you standardize this. Also, you can take one block from WordPress and drop it in another application and take that one from the other application, drop it into WordPress. That interoperability between applications I think is quite fascinating. We&#8217;ll see where it goes. You know, we&#8217;ve heard about Tumblr possibly integrating the Gutenberg and it&#8217;s like, oh, that&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So there&#8217;s services like Zapier. It&#8217;s enormously popular because it enables interoperability. That&#8217;s basically all it does. And people use it all the time to just connect the dots with all the disparate services they&#8217;ve got, and if we could have that in the future and it was block based, that would be really great. I wouldn&#8217;t have to have a giant bill for Zapier every month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:56] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> Exactly. Well, one of the things I think, even in a block architecture, I know full site editing is brand new, and we won&#8217;t get into that discussion, but the idea behind full site editing is everything is a block. And when you standardize every piece of content on your website as a block, then you can start just doing interesting things with blocks because everything&#8217;s a block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can create plugins that target blocks, and all of a sudden you can target the entire website. And so, by already moving to a block based architecture, we&#8217;re starting to move in the direction where you can start moving blocks around much simpler because it&#8217;s a standardized unit of content. As opposed to random things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I know that the idea of everything is a block is beguiling and it sounds great. Do you think some things shouldn&#8217;t be in the domain of blocks? So, sorry to drag you into full site editing, but you know, it&#8217;s the best example I can conjure up at this moment. Things like navigation as a block. It&#8217;s tricky. It&#8217;s difficult to use and it feels almost like it&#8217;s throwing the baby out with the bath water a bit, because I know the current interface is a bit old and maybe people don&#8217;t like that and they would love it to be in a block, but it kind of feels, don&#8217;t break. What&#8217;s the phrase? If it isn&#8217;t broken, don&#8217;t. Yeah. Yeah, that, that phrase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:02] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> No, I agree. I think that there are certain components that are really hard to build in block form. And taking the navigation, for example. It&#8217;s really tiny. It&#8217;s at the top of the screen and manipulating all your links and sub navigation, it&#8217;s very challenging. I think that having that be a block under the hood is fine, but the way that users interact with it needs to be greatly improved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s the UI? The principle of it being a block is fine, it&#8217;s just the UI that needs potentially addressing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:28] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> In many ways you could have taken the old UI, and under the hood made it all blocks, but keep the same UI, and that would be fine. It&#8217;s the moving things around and trying to manipulate it. It&#8217;s very hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And because it&#8217;s hard, and because these things pop up in our WordPress, we get version 6.1 and we&#8217;ve got all these new things, and we&#8217;ve gotta figure out what&#8217;s going on. Do you find that you are having to fight this fight often? Every time a new version of WordPress comes out, do you need a new line of defense? Okay don&#8217;t worry it&#8217;s going to be alright?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:57] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> Yes, and I think that it&#8217;s one of those, so we&#8217;re doing the walkthrough next week for 6.1, where we&#8217;re going to try to show everybody all the cool stuff that&#8217;s coming out. You do a disservice to WordPress by not pointing out things that need improving. Navigation block is one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to be honest about the fact that it&#8217;s not the best it can be. Because new users are going to get in there and they&#8217;re going to get frustrated. And one of the biggest, not, again, not to get, toot my own horn here, but the biggest thing for me is consistency. So one of the things that we haven&#8217;t had in WordPress is the same typography controls on every block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I could change font family on my headings, but not my paragraphs. You know, that kind of stuff really starts to confuse people, especially new users. And with 6.1 we&#8217;re starting to get some of that consistency. Big, big effort now to improve consistency across blocks. And we won&#8217;t get people to get excited about things and use this new stuff, but we need to be, we need to recognize when things aren&#8217;t perfect, and what can we do to improve them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thanks Nick for joining us today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:54] <strong>Nick Deigo:</strong> Thanks so much.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://nickdiego.com/\">Nick Diego</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick is a Developer Advocate at WP Engine. He can be found creating educational content, building plugins and themes, and contributing to WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s on the podcast to talk about his passion and optimism for the future of WordPress using blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the recent WordCamp US, Nick gave a presentation entitled, ‘Let’s Build a Custom Block in 15 Minutes’. It was his attempt to show a group of WordPress enthusiasts that the barrier to creating blocks is slowly being eroded, due to the creation of new tools. These tools are creating opportunities for people who might otherwise have stayed away from block development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s becoming easier to create the blocks, as the tools take away much of the technical burden of getting you up and running without advanced knowledge of JavaScript and React. Coupled with core components, native block supports, and a bit of guidance, Nick thinks that every WordPress developer can add custom blocks to their repertoire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s clear that Nick is all in on blocks, and during the podcast he makes the case for why you should be too. They offer so many opportunities for what can be displayed on a page, and their capabilities are only getting better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about how WordPress core blocks are trying to support developers by adding components and block supports so you don’t have to repeat the development work already done by others; you can build on top of previous work and save yourself valuable time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a fascinating chat, especially for those who are, as yet, undecided about whether they want to embrace WordPress blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, when we record the podcast, there’s not a lot of background noise, but that’s not always the case. Over the coming weeks, I’ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artefacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listenable, I hope you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorial/using-the-create-block-tool/\">Using the create-block Tool tutorial</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stable-diffusion/\">Block Diffusion – Generate images from text prompts</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"Do The Woo Community: devlife_snippet: An Easy Accessibility Tip for WooCommerce Site Builders\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://dothewoo.io/easy-accessibility-tip-for-woocommerce-site-builders/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:446:\"<p>How can you know if your WooCommerce website your building works for disabilities?

More than 3.4 million websites use WooCommerce, according to Builtwith, including 25% of the top million online stores. It is by far the most popular solution among WordPress sites with e-commerce, capturing 93% of the market share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maiorana covered some industry-wide trends taking shape in 2023. WooCommerce merchants are uncertain about the economy and while some are optimistic, others do not see it improving soon. Although growth has slowed since the pandemic-fueled rapid acceleration towards e-commerce in 2021, Maiorana said revenues are projected to gain steadily through 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce core is entering a transformative time, as the new admin has been fully merged and Cart and Checkout blocks are now part of core (in beta). The plugin is becoming more block friendly with more than 40 blocks available now. WooCommerce has seen a 319% increase in the usage of block themes and is aiming to have full out-of-the-box compatibility with any block-based theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Market for Hosted WooCommerce Products Is Heating Up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest announcements from the event was that WooCommerce is developing its own hosted, turnkey solution in collaboration with hosting partners. WordPress.com will be the first to pilot the product in February 2023. Maiorana said the goal of the solution is to improve onboarding and retention with the following :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WooCommerce pre-installed, activated, and hosted</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A pre-packaged set of essential plugins</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Simplified onboarding that works with partners&#8217; systems to improve conversion</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Competitive monthly price to reduce churn</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Co-marketing and revenue share with hosts</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce&#8217;s hosted solution will be in direct competition with other hosts that have recently launched their own products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 2021, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-pagely-to-deploy-new-woocommerce-saas-product\">GoDaddy acquired Pagely</a> with the intent to deploy a new SaaS WooCommerce product. Pagely was paired with previous 2020 acquisitions of Poynt, a payment processor, and SkyVerge, a popular WooCommerce plugin development company, to create an integrated solution. Last month, GoDaddy <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/garage/managed-woocommerce-stores-coming-soon/\">launched</a> an open access preview of <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/offers/mwcs-mlp\">Managed WooCommerce Stores</a> to US-based customers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s solution boasts the ability to sync across marketplaces, including Amazon, eBay, Google, Walmart, Etsy, and YouTube, with a single dashboard managing payment processing, marketing, shipping, and inventory. It is integrated with GoDaddy Payments for both online and in-person transactions, which incur a transaction fee of 2.3% + 30¢. The hosted WooCommerce preview plans range from $99.99/month &#8211; $249.99/month.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>At WooSesh today, Beka Rice, Senior Director of Product Management at GoDaddy, gave <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/BekaRice/woosesh-2022-connected-commerce\">an overview of multichannel and omnichannel sales for e-commerce merchants</a> during her presentation. Enabling multichannel store management seems to be one of the main selling points of GoDaddy&#8217;s offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Bluehost is another recent contender in the managed WooCommerce hosting space, having launched its product last month. In March, Newfold Digital, Bluehost&#8217;s parent company, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/newfold-digital-acquires-yith-to-expand-woocommerce-expertise\">acquired YITH</a>,  a WordPress plugin company with more than 100 WooCommerce extensions. Bluehost&#8217;s managed WooCommerce packages include a curated set of YITH plugins to help merchants extend their stores to offer gift cards, bookings and appointments, wishlists, product filtering, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bluehost offers two plans. For the first year, when billed yearly, customers pay $9.95/month for a simple store or $12.95/month for selling across various marketplaces. Customers on the more expensive plan have the option to manage product inventory across Etsy, Amazon and eBay from a consolidated dashboard via Ecomdash. At the budget end of the WooCommerce hosting spectrum, Bluehost&#8217;s offering has an emphasis on creating a user-friendly, guided onboarding experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Bluehost conducted an internal research study last year and found that its small business customers were looking for solutions that would allow them to sell online, but many  of them are first-time website creators. The company created this new WooCommerce offering to eliminate the hassle of navigating themes and the many plugins required to launch a store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bluehost uses YITH&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wonder.yithemes.com/.\">Wonder theme</a> as the stores starting theme, which we <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/yith-wonder-a-new-free-wordpress-theme-with-support-for-woocommerce-and-full-site-editing\">reviewed</a> in August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our theme is built for WordPress, utilizes the block structure that modern WordPress websites are beginning to adopt (one of the early block-based<br />WooCommerce block themes) and also includes three full-page patterns for different homepage layouts and designs,&#8221; Newfold Digital SVP of Digital Presence and Commerce Jason Cross said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This not only provides users with a modern looking store, but also allows them to continue to customize it with ease in the future. YITH Wonder comes with six different style variations that make it easy to customize the accent color combinations and typography for the site.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bluehost&#8217;s offering is aimed at catering to the merchants who will be building the stores themselves. The company has not created its own payments solution but connects to popular payment providers such as PayPal and Stripe and offers cash on delivery and in-store pickup options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce is at the start of its journey towards launching a hosted solution but the company also plays a different role in the ecosystem as the maintainer of the core software. In an interview with the Tavern after his keynote, Maiorana said the vast majority (+90%) of ongoing WooCommerce core development is done by the WooCommerce team at Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One important difference is that we are really focused on the WooCommerce ecosystem – including the thousands of web hosts that help support and drive WordPress and Woo adoption across the globe – as our most important &#8216;customer,\'&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And what we’re hearing from these customers is that it is challenging to compete with the simplicity offered by proprietary, turnkey e-commerce solutions. At the same time, many web hosts don’t have the capabilities to address things like onboarding, conversion, and retention holistically – they need our help to compete and win.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the major hosting companies that serve WordPress customers, like WP Engine, GoDaddy, and Bluehost have already developed their own hosted WooCommerce solutions, although there are many smaller companies that do not offer curated plugins, themes, and friendly onboarding that may be more open to partnering with the makers of WooCommerce. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We’re also working with a &#8216;core first&#8217; perspective,&#8221; Maiorana said. &#8220;That means that our efforts here will help drive improvements directly back into the core WooCommerce experience and across other, related extensions. We want to take everything we learn and any benefits we discover back to every WooCommerce user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We think the winning strategy for the WooCommerce community is not to split efforts or keep these innovations to ourselves, but instead work together to make WooCommerce better for everyone.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maiorana could not share any more details of the solution they are developing, but with more than 800 products in the WooCommerce.com marketplace, the company has the ability to offer a compelling deal on extensions for those who host with them. WooCommerce is also currently beta testing WooPay, a single-click cross-site checkout experience that uses WooCommerce Payments. Integrating WooPay with WooCommerce&#8217;s network of hosting customers may also give the new checkout (and WooCommerce Payments) a major boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With WooCommerce soon to be in the running with its solution hosted on WordPress.com, the competition around managed e-commerce hosting is starting to heat up. It may no longer be enough for hosting companies to simply offer WooCommerce and Storefront pre-installed. Although the largest hosting companies have been acquiring WooCommerce plugin shops in order to create compelling packages of store functionality, there&#8217;s room for diverse offerings in a wide range of pricing tiers, as WooCommerce adoption continues to grow.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 04:23:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"HeroPress: The good and the bad of open source WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=4883\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:164:\"https://heropress.com/essays/the-good-and-the-bad-of-open-source-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-good-and-the-bad-of-open-source-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5984:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/101222-2-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Ultimately, I’m glad that WordPress is open source, even despite the drawbacks.\" />\nHere is Lesley reading her own story aloud.\n\n\n\n<p>Why I believe open source is the best and worst thing about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first discovered WordPress in 2016, it was merely a tool for me. It was the cheapest and most flexible way to get a website started for my fledgling explainer video business, so I used it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a long time blogger and website-maker, since the days of GeoCities, I was very confident I would find WordPress a breeze to use. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>I opened up a fresh new install of WordPress for the very first time in my life and was confronted with an intimidating admin interface. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The stuff on the right seemed meaningless and unhelpful, and the stuff on the left was way more complicated than I was used to. What did media library mean and when do I use it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was lucky that I’d been making websites and blogging since I was a child. It was also a good thing that I knew WordPress was really <em>really</em> popular. Had it not been for those two things, I would likely have given up. Instead, I powered through, confident that, if millions of people could figure it out, I could too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some tinkering, and reading recommendations, I purchased and installed a page builder, Thrive Themes, and started building my site. I watched many tutorials, made tons of mistakes, and got frustrated countless times. But after a month or two, it finally felt like I’d gone from pushing a boulder uphill, to chasing the boulder downhill. Incidentally, I still use Thrive today!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"kt-adv-heading_262ee3-78 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Why Open Source Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I owe a big part of my journey to the open source nature of WordPress. Being able to play around for almost no money allowed me the freedom to experiment and make mistakes with little penalty. I didn’t have to worry about paying $50 or even $5 per month for each random side project I start, which allowed me to play around and really deepen my knowledge of building websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>I bet lots of other people attribute their web building journey to WordPress and open source too. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s likely to be a large reason for WordPress’ popularity. It’s free for anyone to use, so lots of hosts offer it as one of their default options. There are also loads of plugins out there that help you turn your WordPress site into anything you can possibly imagine. It means that a receptionist or a journalist can move from one job to another and easily log into their company’s website, update the opening hours or write a blog post, because everyone is on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It means a first-time business owner like myself can create their first website and not worry about making newbie mistakes since the cost of wrong decisions is low – it’s really easy to migrate from host to host, change themes, remove plugins and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"kt-adv-heading_c0af34-ca wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Where&#8217;s It&#8217;s Not Perfect</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>However, open source is not without its drawbacks. Like I mentioned above, the first time I logged into WordPress I found it overwhelming. It’s hard to draw a direct line to the exact reason why, but here are some of the reasons that came to mind:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there isn’t a dedicated team with KPIs to hit who are focused on making onboarding super easy for complete beginners. In commercial software, this is typically a top priority as customers who can’t get onboarded, will usually churn, which loses money for the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, in WordPress, we have contributors who are typically seasoned WordPress pros. They no longer remember what it’s like to use WordPress for the first time. And because of the contributor model, we also don’t have enough teams with dedicated UX researchers, product managers, and more for each aspect of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, WordPress is largely built by developers with a developer-first mindset. Thus, the teams are conceived from a developer standpoint (performance, multisite, etc) rather than from a user standpoint. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>For example, it would be wonderful to have teams focused on the experiences around onboarding, dashboard, plugins, themes, which is how the average user mentally structures WordPress.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, it’s impossible to keep track of usage data, so there’s no way to know where people are struggling across the entire WordPress project. This matters because the best way to justify having teams focused on certain aspects of WordPress is to present numbers. However, since we don’t have numbers, it’s impossible to present a strong case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final issue is that WordPress is gigantic. It powers everything from The American Whitehouse website, to small businesses in Singapore (like mine). This pins WordPress in a very tricky spot, because the needs of the Whitehouse are very different to the needs of a small business on the equator. And any updates that are made to WordPress have to take the breadth of use cases into consideration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, I’m glad that WordPress is open source, even despite the drawbacks. It helps so many people grow their businesses, communicate, and simply share their thoughts with everyone on the internet. There is no such thing as only good without the bad. And I’m glad WordPress exists.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/the-good-and-the-bad-of-open-source-wordpress/\">The good and the bad of open source WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 00:00:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Lesley Sim\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.1 Release Candidate 1 (RC1) Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13579\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/wordpress-6-1-release-candidate-1-rc1-now-available/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9422:\"<p>The first release candidate (RC1) for WordPress 6.1 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This is an important milestone in the 6.1 release cycle. “Release Candidate” means that this version of WordPress is ready for release! Before the official release date, time is set aside for the community to perform final reviews and help test.

The shop currently distributes its <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/hestia/\">Hestia</a> (100K+ installs) and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/neve/\">Neve</a> (300K+ installs) themes on WordPress.org, commercializing pro versions with upgrades and support. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/raft/\">Raft</a> is the latest addition to the lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to full-site editing support, the WordPress directory still leans a little heavy on blog themes, but Raft was designed to suit a wide-ranging variety of use cases, as stated in the theme&#8217;s description:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;It’s perfect for blogs, small business, startups, agencies, firms, e-commerce shops (WooCommerce storefront) as well as personal portfolio sites and most types of projects.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the default homepage looks simple, it&#8217;s the block patterns that make this theme ready for anything. Raft includes patterns for creating a cover image with title and background, image galleries with a title, post query loop, two columns for features or services, three columns of features, call to action, FAQ, inverted background, and a hero section. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>When users first install the theme, it prompts them to install the free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/otter-blocks/\">Otter Blocks</a> plugin, which adds more page building blocks and customization options. Raft also has compatibility with Elementor, Brizy, and Beaver Builder, in addition to Gutenberg, and support for WooCommerce. The Pro version of Otter Blocks contains more advanced WooCommerce blocks for building complex store layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>After activating the theme on a new install, clicking &#8220;Customize&#8221; takes the user to the Site Editor where it will be pre-filled to look nearly identical to the <a href=\"https://themeisle.com/demo/?theme=Raft\">demo</a>. There&#8217;s not much to the demo &#8211; it keeps the pages fairly simple and <a href=\"https://demosites.io/raft/patterns/\">showcases the patterns</a> on a separate page. Raft isn&#8217;t quite a blank slate but it does leave some room for the imagination, as it&#8217;s not stuffed full of content and animations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme comes with eight beautifully designed style variations, each with harmonious color combinations that create a different vibe for the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image source: <a href=\"https://themeisle.com/themes/raft/\">Themeisle</a>\n\n\n\n<p>Rift packages full-site-editing templates that users can edit to further customize the main pages like 404, single blog posts, the front page, archives, and more. It also includes a blank page template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Themeisle markets its popular classic themes on WordPress.org with pro versions that include starter templates, additional header and footer options, custom layouts, WooCommerce layouts, and other features. The company has not created a pro version for Raft. They may still be developing upgrade options but the world of blocks changes the game, since custom layouts are much easier to create with the block editor. User expectations are different. It will be interesting to see how Themeisle markets its first block theme compared to its classic products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rift is a good option if you need a lightweight theme that isn&#8217;t too opinionated but still provides the basic design as a starting place for building pages and customizing them with more advanced tools as necessary. If you are already one of the 100k+ Otter Blocks users, this theme integrates seamlessly. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/raft/\">Raft</a> is available to download for free on WordPress.org. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 03:53:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"Do The Woo Community: devlife_snippet: Security Bugs, a Missed Learning Opportunity\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73083\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"https://dothewoo.io/security-bugs-and-woocommerce-developers/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:436:\"<p>When a security bug report goes unanswered or is ignored, this is a potential learning experience that is being missed by that developer.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/security-bugs-and-woocommerce-developers/\">devlife_snippet: Security Bugs, a Missed Learning Opportunity</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 16:07:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:151:\"Gutenberg Times: Style Variations in Theme Directory (Beta), first Devnotes for WordPress 6.1, eCommerce blocks by EDD and Woo – Weekend Edition #232\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=22382\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:153:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/style-variations-in-theme-directory-beta-first-devnotes-for-wordpress-6-1-ecommerce-blocks-by-edd-and-woo-weekend-edition-232/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21593:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next week is release week, with Release Candidate 1 (RC1) for WordPress 6.1 scheduled for Tuesday, and Gutenberg 14.3 stable scheduled for Wednesday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>RC1 is the time when developers also published their Dev Notes for the Fieldguide, that covers all the changes, fixes, and features coming to a WordPress instance near you soon.

Dan Soschin has posted the update <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/wordpress-6-1-beta-3-now-available/\"><strong>WordPress 6.1 Beta 3 Now Available</strong></a>. You can help test it by following the call for testing </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Sneak Peek: The meta-team just released the <strong>beta version</strong> of d<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6059\"><strong>isplaying Style Variations in the Theme Directory</strong></a>, a trac ticket opened by <strong>Carolina Nymark</strong>.  You can browse an <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/?beta=style_variations\"><em>example with the Twenty-Twenty-Two theme. </em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developer <strong>Steve Dufresne</strong> <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6059#comment:17\">commented </a>:  &#8220;To turn on the feature, add <code>?beta=style_variations</code> to the URL. The URL gets updated when you browse themes, so you&#8217;ll need to re-add it for each theme page and reload. If nothing loads, there are most likely no style variations for that theme—your best chance of finding them is in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">&#8216;Block Themes&#8217;</a> category.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you click on the small variation card below the screenshot you will notice that the screenshot changes to show in with the variation applied. Very slick. The growing interactivity on the Theme directory makes it great fun to spend more time browsing themes and be fascinated by all the creativity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Reminder: This is still hard hat area, travel at your own risk. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/poe/?beta=style_variations\"><img /></a>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>WP Briefing &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/episode-40-all-things-testing-with-special-guests-anne-mccarthy-and-brian-alexander/\"><strong>Episode 40: All Things Testing with Special Guests Anne McCarthy and Brian Alexander</strong></a>, and they discuss with host Josepha Haden, their work on the Testing Team, the FSE outreach program and how to get started with testing in the WordPress project.

Although the shortcodes still work, the block versions allow for much easier customization with a better UI. One example in the announcement is the Order History block. The previous Purchase History shortcode output a simple table of orders, but the new Order History block has a card style view and allows users to easily modify the number of columns and how many orders are displayed per page. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<img />Purchase History shortcode output\n\n\n\n<img />New Order History block\n\n\n\n\n<p>The other blocks have been updated in a similar fashion, with extended functionality and greatly expanded customization options. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the new Checkout block was released in beta. It is not turned on by default for new stores yet. Users who want to test the block will notice that EDD has reordered some of the fields to improve conversions, improved the user context detection (only showing necessary fields to users), and redesigned the payment method picker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Email Summaries is a new feature for store owners in 3.1. It sends a weekly or monthly email to the admin or other custom recipients with a store update that includes metrics like gross and net revenue, new customers, and average order amount. It can also be disabled in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>A few other notable changes in version 3.1 include the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>New setting to require users to login to download files </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Success Page has been renamed to Confirmation Page to differentiate it from the receipt</li>\n\n\n\n<li>More detailed views and filtering options for Reports</li>\n\n\n\n<li>reCAPTCHA keys added to Downloads » Settings » Misc so users can automatically enable reCAPTCHA for the lost password and the registration forms</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New color options for purchase buttons</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New &#8220;View Receipt&#8221; link in the orders table</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/\">Easy Digital Downloads</a> is installed on more than 50,000 WordPress sites.

Feedback on the event was all positive, mostly due to the non-lecture way that Allie presents on the topic, and also the workshop approach to challenging the attendees to think about their current beliefs and how they consider themselves allies, how they think they can do better, and how we can all challenge ourselves to think about our place in the community to one another.

The report contains data on page content, user experience, content publishing, and distribution with contextual insights from subject matter experts. It draws from a dataset that evaluates millions of web pages and is continuously updated on a monthly basis. Metrics from the June 2022 crawl, used for the report, are <a href=\"https://github.com/HTTPArchive/httparchive.org/blob/main/docs/gettingstarted_bigquery.md\">publicly queryable</a> on BigQuery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/cms\">CMS chapter</a> is of particular interest to WordPress users and product developers. HTTP Archive&#8217;s dataset, which is based on <a href=\"https://www.wappalyzer.com/technologies/cms\">Wappalyzer’s definition</a> of a CMS, identified more than 270 different CMS&#8217;s. WordPress is still leading the market with 35% adoption on mobile—followed by Wix (2%), Joomla (1.8%), Drupal (1.6%), and Squarespace (1.0%). </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to W3Tech&#8217;s stats, which show <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-attributes-declining-market-share-to-performance-issues-increased-complexity-and-the-lagging-full-site-editing-project\">WordPress market share declining from March &#8211; June 2022</a> and then holding steady, the Web Almanac shows WordPress up 1.4% over 2021 on mobile and 0.2% over 2021 on desktop. The methodologies differ in that W3Tech includes only the top 10 million websites in its statistics, as defined by the <a href=\"https://www.alexa.com/\">Alexa</a> top 10 million and the <a href=\"https://tranco-list.eu/\">Tranco</a> top 1 million list. The Web Almanac&#8217;s data set includes 8,360,179 websites, where 7,905,956 are mobile websites and 5,428,235 are desktop websites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drupal and Joomla are slowly declining and Wix has grown over the past three years, though it still represents just 2% of the CMS market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New in the data this year is the top five WordPress page builders. Wappalyzer&#8217;s detection found that 34% of the WordPress websites in the dataset are using a page builder plugin. It would be interesting to see these numbers compared with how many sites are using just the block editor with block plugins, along with sites using the Classic editor and no page builder, but this wasn&#8217;t part of the data collection here.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor is the most popular among the page builders, sitting at 40% of desktop sites and 43% of mobile WordPress sites. WPBakery is not far behind at 34/33%, followed by Divi, SiteOrigin, and Oxygen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As we see it today, page builders exert significant influence on the performance of a site,&#8221; CMS chapter author Jonathan Wold said. &#8220;Historically, page builders have been anecdotal indicators of poor performance. As one example, our dataset indicates that it’s not uncommon for websites to have multiple page builders installed, adding a significant increase to the resources loaded by a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Now that we’re tracking page builder data, we’ll have the opportunity in future editions to evaluate year-over-year changes in page builder adoption and look for correlations in those changes to the overall performance of WordPress as a CMS.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Web Almanac also published data for Core Web Vitals performance and the results vary widely across CMS&#8217;s. Duda, a drag-and-drop website builder used by less than 1% of websites, is posting the highest numbers with 67% of its sites with passing CWV scores. TYPO3 (62%), Jimdo (61%), and Drupal (50%) are not too far behind. WordPress, which had 19% passing last year is up to 30% in 2022, and is catching up to Joomla (38%) and Wix (39%). Scoring consistently high on Core Web Vitals is more difficult for CMS&#8217;s that are primarily hosted independently around the web, as opposed to a centralized SaaS platform, so improvements here may be more hard won.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The report goes into more detail on the top platform&#8217;s performance across specific metrics, like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). Median Lighthouse performance scores for most platforms were low and in need of performance across the board. SEO scores are consistently high across all of the leading CMS&#8217;s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The median Lighthouse accessibility scores for the top CMS&#8217;s ranges between 77 and 91. WordPress falls in the middle with 86 and Squarespace scored the highest in this category with 91.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report also includes a few other interesting WordPress-specific charts, such as year-over-year adoption by geography. WordPress appears to be the most popular in Spain (39%), Italy (38%), and Japan (38%). </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The Web Almanac also published data for WordPress origins with passing scores for Core Web Vitals by geography. Japan is the leader at 52%, followed by Canada (49%) and Germany (48%).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Also worth noting is the large disparity across geographies, with Brazil at 10% total compared to Japan at 52%,&#8221; Wold said in the report. &#8220;Brazil on the low end is growing, though, improving 100% year-over-year. As we evaluate next year’s dataset, it may be worth investigating the low end performers further to identify potential causes and opportunities for improvement.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the full report in the <a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/cms\">CMS chapter</a> for a more data on the leading platforms.

All of these issues deal with trust — how it can be harmed and the difficulty (and necessity) of repairing it: 1) racism and microaggressions, 2) the sudden removal and uncertain fate of the active install growth chart in the WordPress.org plugin repository, and 3) open source and security. Briefly discussed: emerging US federal policy that aims to secure open-source software. Zero-trust architecture might work well for networked machines, but human relationships and communities need trust.

Challenges arose with reliable project management on the agency side while they tried to establish a foothold in the WordPress plugin market after a first attempt with themes. The <strong>WooCommerce Extensions Store</strong> is where their business took off. With niche extensions that had no competition, they ranked very quickly. Other ideas for plugins solved problems in custom development projects for clients. Eventually, the Keiths developed a formula for evaluating new plugin ideas. Learn from their challenges and successes — there are a lot of interesting details that only come from experience. Hosted by <strong>Cory Miller</strong>.

The way communication has happened — or hasn\'t happened — about this decision is clearly damaging trust in the WordPress community, particularly among business owners with a product in the plugin repository. Ny points out how this all looks to a newcomer to the WordPress community — again, trust takes a beating. But while we lack clarity about the po.  ssible return of install data in some form, Dan suggests asking why this data is trusted and valued by many plugin owners. What business decisions can it helpfully inform? Are there alternative and possibly better sources of data about a plugin\'s users? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Dan briefly talks about the emergence of draft legislation in the US Senate: the Securing Open Source Software Act. It seems likely that in the near future, US security agencies will be getting people, dollars, and new organizations involved in assessing risk in open-source software. Are WordPress auto-updates critical supply chain infrastructure? When should individual freedoms be exchanged for collective security? When do we need to know what our machines and software are doing? When don\'t we? Zero-trust architecture might work well for networked machines, but human relationships and communities need trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Trust can be betrayed in so many ways or failed even with the best of intentions.</p><cite><strong>Dan Knauss</strong></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Nyasha Green, <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/enough-with-this-woke-stuff-and-other-racist-speech-you-can-unlearn/\">Enough with this woke stuff: and other racist speech you can unlearn</a> (MasterWP)</li><li>Mark Zahra, <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/a-sudden-change-leaves-wordpress-plugin-devs-in-the-dark/\">A sudden change leaves WordPress plugin devs in the dark</a> (MasterWP)</li><li>Dan Knauss, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/active-install-charts-removed-from-plugin-repo/\">Active Install Charts Removed from Plugin Repo</a> (Post Status)</li><li>Dan Knauss, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/open-source-communities-you-may-not-be-interested-in-cisa-but-cisa-is-very-interested-in-you/\">Open Source Communities: You May Not Be Interested in CISA, But CISA is Very Interested in You</a> (Post Status)</li><li>Cory Doctorow, <a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2017/09/05/internet-of-lying-things.html\">Our technology is haunted by demons controlled by transhuman life-forms</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-42 wp-block-columns has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"WP-Engine\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-40 wp-block-column\">\n<h3><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/a2-hosting\">A2 Hosting</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A2Hosting offers solutions for WordPress and WooCommerce that are both blazing fast and ultra-reliable.</strong> WordPress can be easily deployed on <em>ANY</em> web hosting plan from A2: Shared, VPS, or Dedicated.

How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Okay. I think! We\'ve got quite a few things cover here, but I think today, the first — the first is probably a topic all onto itself. Something you could spend a lot of time on!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I\'m in the role of like bringing, bringing someone to the family Thanksgiving dinner and having to explain like&#8230; Oh yeah, <em>Uncle</em>—</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said <em>that</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh yeah, So , I wrote an article at Master WP about microaggressions. Mm-hmm. . And you know, usually when I do my social commentary, I do tie it to tech. And I mean, the reason I wrote it was tie it to tech issue, Twilio and claims of reverse racism and hiring and [00:01:00] things like that. And affirm of action and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I saw the conversation around this tech conversation was that, you know, a lot of microaggressions, which I talk about is like, you know, unconscious bias and basically racism. Um, so I was like, you know what, this seems like something that the community really needs to learn about and hear about. So, took my wonderful African American studies degree in research background, , and um, you know, did a good article on microaggressions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. , which led to more microaggressions. That let this hate mail led to me taking a little break from Twitter. But, um, I guess that\'s addressing the elephant in the room. But I mean, I look at it as something as I still don\'t regret writing it. I don\'t regret what led up to writing it because we have a good number of people in the community who are very informed and they are very.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, resp receptive to information like this. I got a [00:02:00] lot of support. I got more support than hate. Okay? So I want to do, I do wanna acknowledge that, but there are quite a few people in the community who actually, you know, they need this information and they ignore it. But you know, that\'s not going to stop me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And although I\'m taking a break from Twitter, you know, it\'s because, you know, I have a lot of other things going on. Um, yeah. So I\'m perfectly fine and I can\'t wait to get back on Twitter cuz I\'m really gonna argue. Yeah. I\'m ready to argue with people. , I\'m just kidding. But I, no, I do miss Twitter. It\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s nice connecting with people of the community. Yeah. Be in a meaningful way. And like I said, there were lots of people who were like, you know, I really needed to hear this. Like, this actually changed my perspective. I think I might buy a book, one of the books you recommended, Things like that. So, Oh good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I can help one person, like that\'s all, that\'s all I need. I don\'t need a, A group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I think it was really good article. I, I haven\'t heard all of the, the stuff that you covered and you did have a, a bibliography at the end, so Yeah. Mm-hmm. , people [00:03:00] wanna read, click through and, and, and get into some more. Um, I thought it was pretty generous and even handed things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s interesting people. Triggered about it because you were pretty clear that microaggressions are, are things almost anyone can do to anybody else for any number of of reasons. Um, but, um, I don\'t know. I\'m, I\'m always, I\'m surprised, not surprised at the kind of reactions that you, you get, um, when you touch these, these subjects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know it\'s, it seems pretty much that women. are the, the targets of, of that when, when there\'s equity and inclusion and justice type subjects that come up. Um, and that kind of bothers me. We talked about that a bit before. Mm-hmm. , the kind of, what I wouldn\'t say it even approaches hate mail and we get the kind of angry I\'m leaving, [00:04:00] I\'m unsubscribing it, you know, you shouldn\'t talk about this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s always anonymous. Um, that comes to me. The, the stuff I\'ve seen, um, that post status gets, Um, I, I think your experience is quite a bit different and that kind of concerns me that, um, people getting, I think a, a pretty, even, even handed and calm, even like calmer than , a very tolerant response to. Some tough issues where there\'s, there\'s definitely kind of abusive things going on out out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the reaction is more of the same a as you said, directed very personally from people who are using their work accounts to do it. And they\'re not hiding their identity at all with you. I don\'t know what they\'re afraid of. They don\'t do that with, with us, but it [00:05:00] kind of, That doesn\'t speak to anything good if they feel confident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, just cutting loose on, on you, on, on women who write, um, something that they don\'t want to hear. And it is, it is exclusively men as far as I\'ve ever heard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. Um, As, as you said, as we talked about people, as you saw on Twitter, people are writing from their Twitter accounts with their WordPress information in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. They\'re sending it from their business address that. Their business, their business, email addresses that have their addresses and phone numbers and stuff. Mm-hmm. , that\'s what\'s, uh, . It\'s interesting to me because even if you, I, it\'s a disrespect thing, honestly. Let me, let me go back. They do it because it\'s, they know like, I can say this to you with my chest, and there\'s no repercussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or they think, they think that, right. And, um, it\'s a disrespect issue. It\'s always amusing to me. Going back a little further to what you said, you were like, you wrote it very like, you know, without emotion. Objectively, I\'ve, I\'ve seen a [00:06:00] lot of people say that. A lot of people said this to me. Mm-hmm. , they were like, this was written like a research paper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Because, you know, one, it was. Two. The biggest thing that I want people to know is that I don\'t have the luxury of being able to be emotional in writings like this. When I write about my race and my gender or things that I have experienced, and the moment I show any sign of emotion, I\'m the wrong person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\'t matter what the other party did to me, right? Because there\'s this big, uh, I don\'t know what you would call it. It\'s this big theory with people discount your experiences and they say it\'s because you\'re emotional. It\'s because you\'re looking to be a victim like you in, like, I enjoy stuff like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t enjoy racism or racist people. I prefer to pretend they don\'t exist. That if I could do that, that\'s what I would do. But, um, I just couldn\'t show emotion. And it\'s been a while since I\'ve written like that. Um, I\'ve been able to show emotion for a while, but I knew with this I couldn\'t. And you see with that, we still got hate mail</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, uh, I got told I was being a victim of, I was like, Of what? [00:07:00] No response. I was like, What am I a victim of? I\'m like, I\'m, this is, I have. Micro aggress against people. I\'ve used ables language, you know, not knowing I\'ve said things, um, toward people that I didn\'t know was harmful. And it was important to me to unlearn that I don\'t care if I didn\'t do it on purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m like, Doesn\'t everyone feel like this? No, they just rather not be told that they\'re doing anything bad at all, ever, even if it\'s unintentional and even if it hurts people, but you know, that\'s them. But for everybody else who wants to learn, I\'m always here .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, it\'s, uh, definitely worth checking out if, um, if you haven\'t seen it enough with this woke stuff and other racist speech you can unlearn, which I think is very inviting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, uh, and yeah, that, uh, it, it can be unlearned that\'s a, a positive. Um, yeah, I\'ve seen mail come in about that, complaining that we don\'t want to hear anymore [00:08:00] of this. Change your thinking, change your mind. Woke stuff. Too bad. Yeah, too bad. Uh, everyone who has that kind of reaction is just a voting for doubling down on, on bigotry or the idea that they have nothing to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and yeah, I know, I think that\'s a pretty honest and good generous starting point that we\'re. There\'s, there\'s not really any way through life and relationships without stepping on people\'s toes, and sometimes intentional, sometimes unintentional. And if you don\'t learn from that, you\'re, you know, that\'s, uh, at some point it\'s not ignorance anymore, it\'s intentional damage you\'re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but I\'m, I\'m glad you wrote it and I hope more, more people. Engage with it, read [00:09:00] it and think about, think about it. Um, I, I think, uh, it\'s a tough one. Cause you, you also tackled the myth of meritocracy, which will die hard in, in tech. Um, , you know, I, everyone\'s a victim who hasn\'t earned their way up or, you know, proven their worth or, or mm-hmm achieved something that I consider, you know, notorious. Yeah, that\'s, there\'s a lot, there\'s a lot more going on in here than I imagine people think who just dismiss it at the title. So that\'s, uh, it\'s definitely worth, worth going through. And honestly, it\'s not in my time. I, I don\'t think this is something we\'ve talked about a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t think it\'s come up, um, a ton in, in just let\'s talk about. Kind of, um mm-hmm. conversations. [00:10:00] Yeah. In reaction to bad events. Un unfortunately in problem individuals and, uh, conflicts that come up. So it\'s, it\'s worth, it\'s worth having that conversation as a running one. And I hope the, um, diversity inclusion, um, equity approach to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the, to not just events, but um, to, um, to help people, um, look at each other and relate in general will. We\'ll make that more of just, this is, this is just normal, right? . There\'s, there\'s a lot of different cultures and perspectives and age groups represented in a large, large community like WordPress and having an open door and open conversation on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s good. Um, anything else you wanted to [00:11:00] get into? About that. I know there\'s, there\'s so many big things looming behind it, but yeah, you need some time to rest, recover, and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, not many big things for me. Um, I just want people to, I, I was worried people were thinking, um, especially the first few days I was off Twitter that I was like somewhere crying. I\'m not,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Oh geez, , no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> This man could not ever in a million years make me cry, baby. But , um, it has encouraged me to keep talking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, if, if the reception was a little more tame, , I definitely probably would\'ve said, You know what? Okay. People heard and they understood. The pushback has made me want to talk about it even more. Mm-hmm. , So I\'m, I\'m cooking up some things and we had Ally, uh, Neon\'s workshop on how to be an ally, which, um mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>talked a lot about microaggressions and a lot of things we were experiencing cuz Ally\'s been through the re, through the wrong. Is that the expression? Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Through the [00:12:00] ringer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Through the ringer. Especially when you talk about, you know, racism in Europe and, you know, Yeah. You can\'t even talk about racism in Europe according to Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, and I\'m going to talk about it. So, and I\'m going to Word camp. I, I don\'t care if no one has Christmas, I\'m going to work Europe next year. But, um, Yeah, we\'re, we\'re gonna keep talking about it. I, I hope to see more workshops. I may do one I don\'t know yet. Um, I\'m gonna keep, I\'m gonna keep talking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, like I said, if I\'m only reaching one person out of all the people that this goes out to, that\'s fine. Yeah. ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Good. No, um. I, I, I think, uh, anyone who thinks that you were off Twitter for any of those reasons is just out of , out of touch. No. Yeah. Pin pinned your flow foot to the floor with a steak knife.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Got bigger. wasn\'t a steak knife, but was a Japanese, a big</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> shift [00:13:00] knife.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> The sword.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> It was a Santo chef knife. It was very sharp. I sharpen it every week. It was an, it was a beast. Let\'s, let\'s embellish this story. Oh. And then, Yeah. I don\'t, I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Jump me. I told you I don\'t, I don\'t want to talk about sharp needles, knives every, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh man, we won\'t, We\'ve been through that. I\'ve been upset when that happened. I was like, Oh, oh, oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> oh. But I just wanted it to be known. It was not a state knife I could have handled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> No, it was huge. A state knife. Yeah. Yeah. It was. Uh, well, I, I hope that that recovery. Goes really well and admire your, your spirit, but it, it is good to get off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is good to get off of the social media and I\'m glad for the supports you\'ve got and the team that is always seems to be a hundred percent behind you and is good with disagreement and, and some amount of, of [00:14:00] tussle and stuff. And, and that\'s. That\'s probably a good move in a good way to move into the, the bigger, the bigger topic in most people\'s minds for this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, yeah. Um, I, I really think the macro microaggression and how people teach, uh, how, how they treat each other. . Um, it\'s just a huge thing on onto itself and it really affects, it impacts trust and I think that\'s the theme, the theme here. And it\'s, it\'s always one in open source and in communities and in relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How, how healthy is our level of trust? Um, For each other. And this, uh, this active install growth chart issue going away has certainly touched a lot of people\'s nerves and confidence or, or trust for, um, their relationship with.org and how things work there. [00:15:00] Have, have you, uh, what are, what are your, what are your thoughts on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, I guess nothing\'s really changed in a week as far as I can tell this morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> That\'s a spicy topic. I don\'t know. I don\'t wanna say the wrong thing. I\'m just kidding. You know? Nah. Um, , no. Um, that was a very interesting topic. Um, I have not jumped a lot into plugin developing. Plugin development. I\'ve wanted to, that\'s something I have on my to-do list for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there\'s so many different aspects of WordPress I want to kind of jump into cuz it\'s very interesting. I don\'t, and I\'m, I\'m being honest, like I don\'t really know how to feel because I\'ve seen both sides of it. Um, you sent me some good information. We had a very good article. Um, I don\'t wanna Bri pronounce his name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Mark Zara. Mark. He\'s a great guy. He\'s, um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> he is, he is awesome. Um, he had a article by him. Oh, go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Oh yeah, he, he brought [00:16:00] it to everyone\'s attention first, I believe. Um, yeah, so for those. Have been under rock or, or new to all this , I think it was late Thursday night, um, a week ago. Um, uh, uh, someone who works for, for Audrey Capital, um mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you would assume like directly. Responding to, to something Matt had re requested, took down the, uh, re reverted the changes in an old track ticket that in 2017, introduced the active install charts that are in the advanced section on plugins, um, in the WordPress DO org plugin repository. So, Plugin owners and really everyone can go in there and see a somewhat obscured, rough estimate of, um, how many sites appear to have your plugin installed on it at the, within the last 24 hours and.[00:17:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then over time, how that needle moves. Is it, is it going up or down? And, and if there\'s a, a growth or decline trend, what\'s that line averaging out to? So that\'s been there for a while and, and people really, a lot of people have really relied onto it. And that just went away with a ticket that just said it\'s insufficiently obfuscated data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So clearly there\'s, there\'s sort of an implication and then further things, there\'s definitely a security issue. The attempt to put out, to make some data public and not all of. Um, completely exact and comprehensive and available to everyone. That wasn\'t the attention, but some, some entity, um, with the capacity or more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know a lot, there\'s a lot of services and people who scrape that, who pull that data in some way. Um, To get a fix on the market, on to offer it as a service to look at other, [00:18:00] your plugins, your competitors, how things are going. Um, that was just pulled and there\'s co, the, the primary code involved, um, is not public, is not out in the open, and it\'s what would be receiving the, the pings from all the sites and interpreting them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As, Okay, does this count as a live site? If so, score one and then making that available through some kind of API where you can pull, um, pull out your current active installs. That too, that\'s the part that apparently has a security privacy issue and needs attention and, um, that has not been formally, officially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly publicly stated, there\'s a discussion in meta slack, uh, mechan and WordPress slack, where this, you know, if you wanna read through, read between the lines and [00:19:00] people unofficially, but who I think are, uh, uh, totally trustworthy and, and know enough about what\'s going on. You can figure out what\'s happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s the article I put together. Uh, trying to take that as at face value. Um, that appears to be what\'s gone on. And you see the, the reaction if you were a plugin owner. In the,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I wanna pause on something you said. You said, Well, if you know that these people are reliable, the right people are telling you the right things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you\'re a newbie like me right to this and you don\'t know these people not saying they\'re not true. Exactly. I don\'t, You know, I, I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> My thought, Who is Triple J? Why should we trust him?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> No, I wouldn\'t say that. I\'m just like, I\'m going off what you\'re saying. You\'re like, Well, these are the right people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m like, Well, you know that. How would I know that? You know? Yeah. That\'s me not playing devil\'s advocate. Cause I think that\'s stupid, but I, that\'s me just like waiting in, like I, I don\'t really [00:20:00] personally know these people. I, I get. , I get the side, I get both sides. Again, because one, I, I looked at it when I was deciding on plugins that I didn\'t really have a lot of information a on because, you know, the more people that seemed to be using it mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>the more reliable it seemed. And so, I mean, I definitely get that as a consumer. I\'m definitely like, Okay, I\'m gonna do a little bit more research and, you know, I\'m lazy. So, you know, that\'s on me, that\'s on them, that\'s on me. But I, I get where plugin owners are panicking over that. Like, it\'s, it\'s their money, it\'s their business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I, I get that. And then like, it does not seem to be a lot of clarity on it. Like especially when it went down, like it just went down like, ugh, you know, we need to fix this. Mm-hmm. . And it was kind of like, that\'s it. And it. , Right? What can we get an explanation? And it\'s like they have to dig, dig, dig.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m, I know speculation is bad in general, especially when you don\'t have all the facts. Um, so I know there\'s been a lot of speculation on what\'s really going on and why it was really taken down, you know, outside of the few statements we got. But [00:21:00] do you blame them? Can you blame them? Like, if you\'re in the dark, all you can do is guess, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And that\'s not helpful from the, from the, um, from a normal corporate communications or community management standpoint. Mm-hmm. not having, not having an internal PR arm, not having some means of, of communicating to stakeholders in ways that calm things and, and spread correct information. Um, is it just.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who does that? So I think a lot, a lot of people feel disrespected, but this isn\'t a new thing. Um, they should know that it\'s, it\'s that way. It\'s been that way for a while and I would assume it\'s wanted to be that way. Um, but if, if you were expecting or wanting something a little more standard, that is not, not the [00:22:00] case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it does lead to people getting wound up. Speculating wildly and, and, uh, with distrust, uh, is spreading a good deal with distrust. And I think that\'s, that\'s what people are going to do every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I mean, and I\'m, I\'m with you on that. It\'s been this way for a long time, so people are pretty much, um, You know, a lot of people pretty much expect it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they\'re like, Well, you know, these things happen. That\'s one way to look at it, but I would like to quote the Great American Television Show The Wire. Oh yeah. And say the thing about the old days. Is they The old days, ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Was that bunk who said that? I think</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> he did. Yeah. It wasn\'t, Yeah. So, um, This is the thing, like, again, me just looking at this from my perspective as a newer person, if I\'m, if I don\'t know to expect these things, how can I expect them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? Like, that\'s a lot, a lot of things happen in community, even outside of this, where it\'s like, well, that\'s how things have been done. And it\'s like mm-hmm. . [00:23:00] Yep. What am I supposed to do? , Like, I, I, Okay. Like I have to, There\'s no onboarding to how things are done. We\'ve talked about,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> That\'s a big issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is your onboarding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. So it\'s like, Trial by baptism. Trial by fire. Yeah, that\'s what I mean. But you know, and I know some people, some people who are still having these conversations, they\'ve been in the community and they\'re used to this, but I mean, it could be, they could be tired of it. They could want change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I, I do agree with you saying like it\'s, it\'s gonna spread a lot of disinformation. No, you didn\'t say disinformation. It\'s gonna spread a lot of disagreement and we really don\'t need that. At all. You know what hashtag WP Drama. Um, but I mean, people also need answers. It\'s like I don\'t have a clear answer for what they should do because when I\'m confused and I feel like I\'m in the dark and nobody\'s giving me answers, I\'m definitely going to complain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And sometimes when you complain, it turns into hashtag WP Drama .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Oh yeah. That\'s almost inevitable. And so seeing it both ways, [00:24:00] Um, it, it shouldn\'t be Mark coming into Post Slack and in Twitter and saying, Hey, did anyone notice this ticket that just kind of crept in there and late Thursday night and, Hey, look, this chart\'s gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that\'s. At once, kind of highly irregular. But then again, is it, is it really to me for this, for this family?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> To this family, I guess not like I\'m the, I\'m the, the, the daughter-in-law, I guess I\'m married into this family. Yeah. I\'m at Thanksgiving. Like, Huh, ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> No, I feel like, yeah. Well, sorry you married into the mob.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, . I apologize for uncle over here. . Um, well, yeah, I, I think trying, I always try to see things multiple ways and, and look for what\'s the most. [00:25:00] Most productive way forward that will align the most people in a understand productive way And what can be learned here? Um, I, I\'m willing to, because John James Jacoby stepped in and is a real long timer and is on the Medi and the ME team\'s a bunch of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good people. Mm-hmm. who, um, were not apparently in the decision making about this, but have some degree of knowledge and oversight or independent, um, takes on. On the non-public code in question and have made it, and I see no reason to, to distrust any of that. So what, what has come out short of it? Not a press release, not something on even the taverns not, you know, being, being quite critical and not not getting any special, um, quotes from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside explaining this, um, what we\'ve got is what\'s come out on the, on the [00:26:00] ticket and it, they\'re saying it\'s a security issue that the either privacy, security, the, the way the data, um, was being pulled and used was over line that they were. Not willing to tolerate going on, and they want to change how that data access works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also trust them that it\'s gonna come back at some point. But what\'s muddied the waters is Matt has, um, disregarded the um, The desire for the, the, the crowd that calling for like a full explanation and, and just kind of leading it going forward with the discussion of, well, what is this data that you want?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, what would, what helps the most? Um, and trying to kind of move things i I, in this direction of competition, how do we promote cooperative competition, Cooper competition, Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> ooh, let\'s make that [00:27:00] a word. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> So it\'s a tough pivot to not to say, Hey, don\'t, let\'s not give you any kind of, we can\'t give you any full, There\'s not even official statement saying, We can\'t officially disclose what\'s going on here, but we\'re trying to remedy it in the meantime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, There\'s a couple of paths, how this could come back and how it could look, what\'s your feedback and input on that. Um, that\'s kind of what\'s being attempted, but the room temperature isn\'t really conducive to the most, um, helpful feedbacks, but just for me, just in watching, I\'m, I\'m, I haven\'t seen a lot of people explain why that one number is so important the way they think it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and it makes me think like if you\'re that fixed on this thing, that could come and go, that wasn\'t there before. And none of the really big businesses are, [00:28:00] um, they\'re, they\'re not living and dying by this, and I\'m not sure anyone really is, you know, eggs all in one basket. Like really, Um, this is a, a wake up call I would think that if, if that\'s how you\'re running your business or you, you think it works that way, maybe you need some other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other ways to analyze your success or, or, um, decline in with your customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Okay. I, I can\'t agree with you there, , but can I cannot, can\'t, cannot. I cannot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Oh. Oh, really? What do you, what what, I mean, what about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Like you said, that\'s, that\'s all fine and dandy for the bigger corporations, but for the smaller person, it\'s like, Whatever, Figure it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find another method. Oh, well I, again, you said this is how it\'s been done, but it\'s like, how many times can you do that to people? Honestly, [00:29:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I, Yeah, I think that\'s a separate thing, right? If you kind of put that aside, this isn\'t a great way to, this isn\'t a great way to handle a community. Um, it\'s not a great way to handle business community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, It is what it is. It\'s happening. We put that aside. That\'s happening. Why do, why do you, you know, even if this hadn\'t happened, why is that? People saying that they go to that chart multiple times every. It only updates every 24 hours. And like the, the, it\'s general, it\'s kind of shotgun analysis. So I would say like maybe a week\'s worth of data would give you, it\'s just kind of a thumbs up, thumbs down on what, on install activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s, that\'s for your free plugin. So if you\'re trying to make, um, if you\'re, your revenue stream is coming elsewhere from a premium product or, or something else, um, this is just people who are trying you out or using. The free [00:30:00] version and it\'s, it\'s just a general pool of, um, not, um, Well actually you can, you couldn\'t, um, you may, it may include, I guess it would include both, but once you have paying customers, I would pay attention to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have direct, you have a bit more direct, um, access to them and focus groups. There\'s a lot of things you could, you could do to, um, to get better. Data on how your, your product\'s being used and there\'s other ways to distribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> You don\'t think that would be a lot on smaller business owners, people, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Sure. It\'s a lot. Um, and I, it\'s always kind of surprised me though, how, um, how. There\'s, there\'s just, Well, you know, everyone wants an easy, an easy way forward, But does that really, does that really substitute for, um, real business intelligence, for real customer [00:31:00] feedback from real contact and relationships?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the people I\'ve seen who seem to effectively build a, um, a small plug-in business who in intentionally are, you know, they\'re not trying to build. Thing at scale. They\'re, they\'re trying to do a company of one. Um, they promote it from the beginning on their, on their own channels. They know more or less who they\'re talking to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re soliciting feedback. Maybe they have the, the code on GitHub, um, or wherever it is. They\'re engaged with a lot of people using it. I just, I don\'t see why a single measure as vague as that one is. Such, such an obsessed over, um, detail. I mean, I, I understand, I hear what people are saying about it. I get that mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>but it, when you actually literally analyze it as like, is, does that make good business sense? I haven\'t, I haven\'t seen that. [00:32:00] The only, the only good one is, and I think it\'s, it\'s kind of a painful scene, but, um, Matt said about this, the same thing people. See it as a thumbs up if they see it going up, it\'s a motivation to keep working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s like, okay, that\'s valid. Like that. That\'s good feedback to give. Um, but what, there are all these other reasons people talk about why this is a, an important business metric to them. And I just, I think almost all of those are highly, highly questionable or at least, you know, you could probably get better information Another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> independent, like, so I, I\'ve never ran a plug-in business. I don\'t know if you have, you have a lot more experience than me. So, I mean, well we aren\'t we just speculating on what they can do. Like, you know, I, I trust Mark, Mark said that was one of the only tools they had, so it\'s going to make it a lot more difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, like, I think that\'s worthy of them [00:33:00] complaining. I think if that was their only tool, like I, I don\'t know. I can\'t, I can\'t like jump in and say, Well they can do this, they could do that. They could go do this cuz I don\'t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, but it\'s their, It\'s their only tool. Cause they\'ve allowed that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'ve allowed that relationship to exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> So it was the easiest. And they like just kind of, I. It\'s, it\'s the easiest tool. So they kind of, it was easier for them to latch onto that instead of doing like alternate things, which they can do now. Is that what you saying? If it\'s,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah, if it\'s really true that, that you put your, your business in the hands of a freemium type of product and the free versions in the repo, and this is the only measure you have of, of your potential market size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s choices you made. I, I . I mean, there are a lot of other, And you went in someone\'s house and, and this was here once and, and some years ago it wasn\'t there. And, um, I, I understand why that, that feels like a, a breach of trust. [00:34:00] But no one ever had a contractor understanding. To the other one, to anything different that this is, that they have a right to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> uh, I think the analogy is, you know, you went into someone\'s house and they said, Hey, it\'s an open. And you can use this thing right here. And they\'re like, Okay. And they use it for years and then they walk into the house one day and it\'s gone. And the person\'s like, Well, it\'s gone. Oh, well tell me why you needed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, it wasn\'t quite that, It was more like someone, someone\'s been coming in the back door in the kitchen and they took the beer cooler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. Someone else has been like sneaking in and doing bad stuff and now everybody, we can\'t pay forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> We gotta go to the, Yeah, we gotta shut this down and, and go and address this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> but there was no communication on that. I found out about the, the communication is cut that through somebody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> There\'s, there\'s two levels. If you look at it, there\'s a, there\'s a much higher level thing here with how much bigger entities are using this data. Mm-hmm. and potentially abusing it, and the need to get everyone on the same page, and [00:35:00] everyone has the same data and even has the ability to hide it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\'t want your business exposed or your dad exposed that maybe that you can, you can put a privacy control on it. Mm-hmm. , but the, the rank and file the small. Smaller business entities that are upset because they\'ve really been relying on this. Um, totally understand that. But it, it does raise questions of why you have that level of dependency and does this number really do all that for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is your business truly going to, to tank or suffer in some way with without this and could having it taken away, whether are your options, do you. Are there any kind of creative ways forward then? Um, I, I would think that there, there are, having watched that space enough and how different businesses operate partly in using the repo, not using it, um, and how they do their marketing, how they do their relationship with their [00:36:00] customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I, I think it. It\'s something that matters a lot to people, like you\'re saying, who are, who are small and maybe don\'t have the capacity, um, or it\'s a part-time thing or a side part project. Mm-hmm. , and they\'re leaning heavily on this rather than other things that maybe they don\'t have time to be doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it raises questions about what\'s ineffective, um, business model, what, what\'s good data and how do you get it? And, I think that there\'s, from above, there\'s a bit of an attempt to push that question on that part of the business community. And I don\'t know if that\'s an effective way to do it, but it doesn\'t seem</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not nice, it doesn\'t build trust. Uh, but I don\'t know, I don\'t know given enough, uh, pain points maybe. I don\'t know. We\'ll see where. Where it goes and the people caught in between on it, I, I feel for them. But, um mm-hmm. , [00:37:00] I don\'t have any, any reason to, to distrust those who have tried to be mediators and I, I think they\'re, I\'m glad they\'re, they\'re there putting, putting in their 2 cents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I feel bad that they\'ve had to be mediators. This is a, a lot to push on someone. It is, but I am interested to see where this goes. And I\'m glad people are talking about it. I, I, I know communication is a bit as of a doozy sometimes, but I\'m glad people are talking about it. Um, I\'m, I think we need to revisit it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listen, visit this cuz what if it just blows over?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I don\'t think it\'ll blow over. I, I think it\'s, I don\'t, I don\'t either. It\'s like a watershed,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I don\'t think at all. . Yeah. But I\'m interested to see where it goes. ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> but it, there is, there is some sense of, um, a desire to redefine that part of the ecosystem, that culture there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Definitely not wanting a [00:38:00] leaderboard of winners and losers or top 10 or something like that, but have some kind of helpful metric that motivates people that, um, is useful to them and isn\'t something that can be gamed and that someone higher up isn\'t pulling out and trying to figure out how can we game these stats or.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aggregate enough of this to, I don\'t know, build an even bigger secondary market for plugins, like a Zillow of plugin and that number is over your head as your business value and, and you wanna flip, you know, you wanna sell. Like this is, things have been moving in that kind of direction. I, yeah, call it financial, a financialized market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don\'t, I don\'t think that\'s really in most people\'s interests when, you know, it\'s like, When the housing market isn\'t people\'s houses anymore and or their homes or community or neighborhood, it\'s just, what\'s the number on this here today and what can I get for it if I were to sell it? Give me a number.[00:39:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, there was a bit, there\'s been a bit of a movement in that direction. I question the, the health of that, but it\'s really a question of pH kinda economic. Culture, open source culture philosophy. What kind of market ecosystem do you want to have? And I think from above they\'re being pretty clear that they want something more cooperative down there, which is tough for people to swallow because on a higher level, these are, they\'re the corporate entities that are playing full bore, um, corporate capitalism, you know, on a, on a higher level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. , um, where. No one\'s suggesting co-opetition between hosting entities. Entities I love, but maybe they should, you know, I mean, in a way, um, it is, it is throughout open source. I mean, there has to be some level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'ll suggest that on Twitter. Yeah. You\'ll be breaking with me. I, I think</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I\'m really like the cons really in, in [00:40:00] favor of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I\'m not a, I\'m not a unrestricted market person and I, I don\'t think the idea of a commons. works with that. You do need limits and at least a culture with some kind of consensus on, hey, we don\'t overly extract this here and there. And, but that\'s right. That\'s, that\'s not a conversation you can have in normal corporate America.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Oh no, But it isn\'t, it is an open source thing and, um, how do we help each other grow? While in the midst of some degree of competition, um, that\'s a really worthy discussion. And uh, it\'s unfortunate. I think that the trust issues are high and the confusion and eventually misinformation may be high and we can\'t have that appropriate conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope we can, but mm-hmm. . [00:41:00] Yeah. Well enough said about that one. I\'m not gonna speculate where it\'s gonna go, but it\'s been a weekend. It\'s been a season,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> The um, the last thing I was gonna ta I don\'t think we\'ll really tackle it too much. No one\'s looking, no one\'s looking at this. Have you? Um, I haven\'t found a single person. I\'m, I\'m start. Poke around and mm-hmm. more technical sources. And I\'d really love for feedback from, from anyone who has, um, closer familiarity with government policy that\'s emerging around security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there\'s a, there\'s finally, this stuff goes back a few years, but there\'s a senate bill, um, that\'s very specifically targeting open source and security and how we can, how things can be changed. [00:42:00] to, I think ultimately is, you know, it\'s about mitigating risk that, um, the US federal government, really any go, any government\'s always concerned with risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re highly invested in open source. Um, and it\'s not open source in particular, Most people will point out software across the board. Um, how can this be exploited and hacked has gotten into the public eye and into. , the, uh, the eye of people in, um, in government whose job is to focus on things like supply chain, security, that, you know, things that are considered public infrastructure, um, in a national interest that we need to secure and can\'t just have people hacking through, exploiting, you know, whatever they think is going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But , there have been plenty of examples and there always will. Will be some. [00:43:00] So we just, we haven\'t really seen that, um, that come down before and I think we will soon. So have you, have you seen anyone talking?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Not really. Um, it seems like something Rob would tackle, um, top Yeah, I think you\'d be interested, but, um, I\'m, My input is as someone who has worked for the state and federal government in a tech capacity, I don\'t have a lot of faith in this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? Can I say that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Why? Get in trouble? I don\'t think you\'d be,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Will they come snatch my microphone? Yeah. bust through my window in the back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Um, you aren\'t gonna quote the giver, are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh, I got other quotes, but I, One per episode. It\'s all get, um, Oh God.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I\'m from the government and I\'m here to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Please. No. Um. I, [00:44:00] I understand. Okay. The big, uh, the big hacks that have been going on, like the, having the Uber , um, you know, there are a lot of con security concerns out there. I get it. But I don\'t see, I guess I just don\'t know enough about this bill to see what they\'re going to do to help. I just feel like it\'s more government regulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I found very, I feel like I found very. Pro Capitalism this episode. Hmm. I\'m thinking</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> on the one hand. Yeah, but on on the other. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Ah, stop me when you see, when you hear stuff. I\'m just kidding. I\'m kidding. Um, dang. I do now I have to, I have to sit with my thoughts now. Um, no. I get the security issues, but I really don\'t see what they\'re gonna do to help, is basically what I,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, it is, I think everyone does have a common problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s mostly. D updates. . Mm-hmm. , The, and how they get. Um, so if you have unup updated, the, the largest problem, you have a really, really big [00:45:00] attack surface. Like the log four j log four shell thing was under the auspices of Apache Project. Uh, it wasn\'t that something wasn\'t unmaintained and, but there was, um, uh, a, a security vulnerability that was discovered that had been around a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just no one had noticed it. And then you needed to patch it quickly and, and distribute. All around something that\'s very widely used, and that is the, the tricky spot. How do you get mm-hmm. , you can\'t. So in terms of, of WordPress, there\'s all these really old installs out there. Mm-hmm. , Um, and some are so old, I, you can\'t push an update too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. , you\'d have to have anyway. Forced updates have become more of a, a less controversial thing. There was a day, oh probably. Not too long ago, year or two, um, when it was, it was controversial for, uh, again, a decision [00:46:00] made by through unknown processes and deciders to we\'re just gonna push a forced update on an insecure plugin or some core thing, um, that\'s emerged and, and that can be done just pushed down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that\'s just becoming more of, of the norm for security. Reasons and how that, there hasn\'t been a really discussion of that, how that fits in the ethics of open source. Um, if I choose to use this software, can you push changes to it against my, um, consent or without my consent and change my client\'s sites and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah, I think we\'ve kind of moved into a place where, It\'s kind of like getting a vaccination, like, like, Oh Lord, please, you wanna opt out? You wanna opt out to this? Um, there\'s a real problem, um, to doing that, but it, I mean, I, that too. I, I, These are, these are [00:47:00] two sides to the openness and, and freedom and rights, Individual rights versus collective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I will not be hopping into the vaccine debate. You know, I\'ll debate anything that is scary to me. , I\'ll still debate it, but people are scary when we talk about vaccines. I get scared. Um, but I, I think that to me, where it goes to me in my mind is for security updates. We don\'t talk enough about, about how computer illiterate, I guess is how you would.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm. A lot of society is getting, especially when you think about the younger generations who are dependent on their phones and tablets and they don\'t really know how to use computers anymore. Sure. It\'s like, um, you have older people who, you know, have struggled with that, and now we have a younger generation and then it\'s like us in the middle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think, I think that\'s going to be an issue because we\'re forcing people to. It\'s update and they don\'t know, You know, they know one version they [00:48:00] can\'t learn, or not that they cannot learn newer versions, but there is not a lot of adequate education out there to learn newer things. And I\'m not just talking about WordPress kind that\'s in my mind, but that goes through a whole host of other software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just, I think we need more literacy before we do stuff like that. I mean, I\'m not opposed to it at all. Um, I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> It would certainly help for trust again, like, um, if you, I think more and more people are just expecting and, and vaguely, maybe they don\'t even understand that their devices are being updated all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I monitored all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Definitely. Don\'t they? Definitely. Don\'t you remember when they said 5G was like causing covid? Did you hear that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Um, that okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Conspiracy theory. That was one. Yeah. Yeah. And I was like, What? And like it was, people were send me stuff, they were like, You\'re in tech. Is this true?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m like, What? And I\'m like, Why would you even begin to believe [00:49:00] this? Where is the correlation? It\'s like people really don\'t. Anything . And it\'s like, you know, I\'m not calling people stupid or ignorant. Please, if you\'re listening and you sent me a covid conspiracy theory, I am not attacking you. Um, I, it\'s just that people are, there\'s too much lack of information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like that\'s the theme of this, uh, of this episode. If you don\'t give people enough information and literacy, they\'ll speculate. They\'ll create their own narratives and then they\'ll spread them. Right? And then we have all this what? And then we\'ll hear stuff when we say what. Yeah. What I do that like 16 times a day, so Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, they, they have so much more to do than just force updates, but I don\'t have the faith that they will do that. That\'s me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, there, there\'s a lot, there\'s a lot that can be done in, in testing and and security practices to make more secure product, but there\'s always gonna be stuff that just needs a hot fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It needs enough to push to it. Dependencies that aren\'t even within the project, but that we use and that some other project [00:50:00] uses. Everyone\'s got to be able to, um, verify what they\'re using, what version it is, maintenance status, and how do you, how do you quickly update a lot of stuff across the network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that\'s all good, but yeah. What, what you\'re saying with a highly, with something, um, as ubiquitous as WordPress or. Apps on your phone. Um, people aren\'t, it\'s better if you can get them educated enough to trust that, okay, this is how this is done and mm-hmm people are trying to keep this secure and here are the risks and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, maybe there\'s some kind of catchall consent. If you know you\'re using this, this is what\'s gonna happen. It would be great if, as a community, talked more about those things too, and then mm-hmm. , um, informed people of, of what to expect about security with client work. It\'s totally, [00:51:00] absolutely necessary to, to explain about the importance of updates, maintenance, and security issues, and, and that being a constant ongoing process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when, when people don\'t understand and then something happens, you get what? The demonn haunted world. I keep thinking of this essay that that\'s a Carl Sagan book. And Corey doctor wrote a great essay a few years back when, when Volkswagen was uh, uh, gaming their catalytic converters or what, whatever that was when they, whoever hooked the hook, the cars up for testing to emission standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it. The computer would realize, ah, we\'re being tested, so let\'s cheat. And we go into cheat mode and give a different output than, um, when you\'re on the road, you want more power delivered to the user and it\'s actually over emission standards. They got caught for that, but it was a sophisticated software [00:52:00] thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BMW did this to, uh, I wanna pronounce these in German way, Ba a. I, I don\'t know how many did this, but I was talking to a friend of a friend musician who bought one of their sprinter vans. He\'s really, uh, fancy bmw, um, vans, and they got, they had to do a recall on all their, Their catalytic converters, um, because they had a cheat system in it too, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they had agreed to some, you know, there was a, there was litigation and they just agreed to replace it all. Not that they had done anything wrong or something like that. And, and he was in the states, he\'s Canadian, bought this thing in, in Canada and it was in the States and the computer on the car, and his van started saying, You have 10 more starts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You gotta get this to a dealer, Do the recall, have the part swapped out, and if you don\'t and, and you need to do that in 10 more starts, you start, you stop and start 10 times this thing\'s not gonna, it\'s [00:53:00] gonna be towed, you know, It will not, your, your vehicle will no longer function. Um, so it\'s like ransomware built into thereby the, the manufacturer of your vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, huge. Shift from . I don\'t think you knew that that was even possible. They left the thing running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Well, , that reminds me. I do. Because that reminds me of the, the, I don\'t know if I\'ve never had it, but I\'ve known people who\'ve had these type of cars. If you don\'t make a payment on your car, you miss a payment, they cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They really just lock your car and then you can\'t crank your car up. Yeah, you can\'t use your car. You\'ve never heard of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Like they do remotely through the card. They do it remotely disabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'m, I\'m, I thought that happened to many people. Like I\'ve had people go to pump gas and then they can\'t crank their car up and they\'ll say, Oh, you owe it\'s money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> My car is older than my oldest kid. I have a 1997 crv. Like the early years were, were really good. I have a Honda [00:54:00] guy, um, who um, yeah, like, yeah, I\'m an old tech person, , so you couldn\'t Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> that\'s, but that\'s like, that was kind of old. That\'s like, I learned of that when I was like a teenager and that was like, oh my.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am about to turn 32. I was around 15. That was, I\'m doing math 17 years ago, .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> So yeah, I think that\'s, I stuff should be built to last some things and maintain. Oh yeah, definitely. And I don\'t like the idea of. Of being surveilled and controlled remotely. Oh, yeah. Um, and that\'s, um, that\'s the world we\'re moving into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. and to some extent there, you know, well there\'s real abuse and ethics issues and uh, personal autonomy. And I don\'t think that kind of car system is at all what anyone in open source wants or, or just coming. But there\'s always a trade off to, uh, with security, how do we, how do we protect. [00:55:00] Ourselves, Um, the most people efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\'s, it\'s by overriding, you know, anyone who might individually say, Wait a minute, I wanna evaluate this update code before, you know, most people are just gonna sit on an unup updated thing and mm-hmm not know what\'s going on. And that\'s, um, ultimately you have authorities saying that\'s just not okay cuz it\'s a security risk to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much more, much more significant higher level interest than, you know, Bob Smith with his whatever software he is running. Mm. Well, I think that\'s a, that\'s just a fascinating, ethical, intellectual thing, and I, I hope, I hope that we can find a few people to kind of dig more into that as, as that goes along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, yeah, trust. Everything\'s about trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> You [00:56:00] made me think about trust falls. Trust. Trust falls when someone like stands on a chair and you all hold hands. Oh, that,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. I\'ve never done that. Uh, no. I didn\'t</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> want, I was scared. Yeah. I didn\'t trust, I did not trust those people. But, but no, you\'re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trust is, is that today\'s word? That\'s a big word for Elmo. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Just cause people are being, just cuz people are being nice and communicating well with you doesn\'t, you know, you assume good intentions, but I mean, trust can be betrayed in so many ways or failed, um, even with the best of intentions. And I think how we recover from it, there\'s no ideal state, you know, no human group is gonna have pure trust unless they\'re completely in denial, like a cult or something about how everything is awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s always damage. In and histories of, of um, reasons not to trust each other in any long relationship. [00:57:00] And you kind of have to find a way to be resilient through that and recover from it and reassure each other. Yeah, we\'re aligned. We want the same things, pretty much. Um, I\'m not, I, you know, and I\'ve got your back and that\'s what we need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s hard to come by.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I agree.

TL:DR; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/twigpress/status/1577668588923559937?s=20&t=fkpkDh0STrS3M6ql88yBIg\">Not as much</a> as you’d think. This kind of transparency into the entrepreneurship side of WordPress can be so valuable and helpful for everyone to see. I suspect many of us can relate to this, especially in the WordPress space where our abilities as developers, designers, and builders are often taken for granted or undervalued. Carl’s answer is creating a <strong>Github</strong> sponsored page, which is a great way to show appreciation for a developer\'s work, especially the free plugins that they maintain. <strong>Aurooba Ahmed</strong> has made <a href=\"https://github.com/aurooba/sponsor-wp-contributors\">a list of developers you can sponsor</a> as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The 50% Coding 50% Marketing Lifecycle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We see it all the time: some application or website comes out with half the features of a similar idea you’ve been toiling away on for months, maybe years, but they get all the traction because they market the heck out of their brand. Chances are they also probably hired a small marketing team or agency to help them, and for many of us, we don’t have that luxury. Enter <a href=\"https://www.bannerbear.com/blog/why-you-should-do-50-coding-and-50-marketing-as-a-solo-tech-founder/\">the 50:50 concept</a> from <strong>Jon Yongfook</strong> of <strong><a href=\"https://www.bannerbear.com/\">Bannerbear</a></strong>. It sounds like it would be complicated but it’s really simple. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Oh Look, Somebody Took Something Away and Didn’t Communicate About It Well, That Tracs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This week’s #WPDrama has surrounded the abrupt removal of the <em>install growth charts</em> for security reasons on <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress.org</a> and the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511\">Trac ticket created</a> in response to that from Post Status member <strong>Mark Zahra</strong> which highlighted the frustration felt across the plugin community. I cannot stress enough that all of these frustrations could have been avoided by good communication with the community right after the removal. Instead, everyone was left to piece together different conversations on <strong>Twitter</strong> and <strong>Make WordPress Slack</strong> to understand what might be the future for getting similar or even better analytics into the <strong>Plugin Directory</strong>. As of this writing, there still is no response from the team that removed this feature or what a process might look like for future analytics improvements. Again, an open-source project the size of WordPress should have a team just to help write a synopsis of major changes so anyone can understand the why, when, where, and what’s next.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-44 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2>Cool Tool</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each week we feature one cool tool that can help make your life easier as a WordPress builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Move Around The WordPress Admin Faster and Cleaner</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me introduce you to <strong><a href=\"https://turbo-admin.com/\">Turbo Admin</a></strong>, from Post Status member <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/magicroundabout\">Ross Wintle</a></strong>. This little tool makes the WordPress Admin feel more like using the <strong>Siri</strong> or <strong>Alfred bar by giving you a command palette</strong> and a few <code>wp-admin</code> improvements like being able to hide all notices. Turbo Admin is packaged primarily as a browser extension for <strong>Chrome</strong>, <strong>Edge</strong>, and <strong>Firefox</strong>, but it also comes as a plugin. What’s really cool about the extension is that you can use it on any site you have <code>wp-admin</code> access to with no need to install the plugin. This makes it very useful on client sites without adding another plugin to their stack.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div><p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Oct 2022 13:45:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"<span class=\'p-author h-card\'>Daniel Schutzsmith</span>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"Akismet: New API Endpoints to Keep Track of your Akismet Usage\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=2429\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2022/10/07/new-api-endpoints-to-keep-track-of-your-akismet-usage/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:887:\"<p>We&#8217;ve recently deployed, and documented, two new <a href=\"https://akismet.com/development/api/#detailed-docs\">API endpoints</a> that can help you automate keeping track of your Akismet usage, as well as of which sites are querying our API using your Akismet key.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://akismet.com/development/api/#usage-limit\">Usage Limit</a>: an endpoint to keep track of your Akismet API usage for the current month.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://akismet.com/development/api/#key-sites\">Key/Sites Activity</a>: an endpoint to keep track of the sites that are using your API key.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>We&#8217;re Here to Help</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help integrating with these, or any other of our <a href=\"https://akismet.com/development/api/#detailed-docs\">API endpoints</a>, please don’t hesitate to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://akismet.com/contact/\">get in touch</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Oct 2022 13:41:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Stephane Daury\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"Do The Woo Community: WooBits: The Future HQ of Do the Woo in Porto, Portugal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73074\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://dothewoo.io/the-future-headquarters-of-do-the-woo-in-porto-portugal/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:421:\"<p>I haven\'t talked much about our move to Porto, Portugal and what this means to Do the Woo and its next iteration.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;

A single track will run approximately 26-28 presentations during the course of the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Accessibility Day would be remiss without accessibility accommodations in place. Organizers are endeavoring to provide the most accessible experience possible with the resources they have, including the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Videos will stream via YouTube with closed captions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Transcripts will be available through StreamText.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Slido will be used for chat and submitting questions to the speakers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Opening remarks will begin at 14:45 UTC (11/2/2022 at 10:45 AM America/New_York) and attendees are welcome to join for any sessions throughout the 24 hours. <a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/participate/attend/\">Registration is now open</a> and it&#8217;s free to attend.

A <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511\">ticket</a> calling for bringing back the charts is home to a heated discussion on the matter but so far the developer community has not been able to get any clear answers on why access to the data was cut off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his first response on the ticket, Matt Mullenweg asked developers to explain their reasoning for bringing the stats back, without communicating why they were removed in the first place, asking them to present &#8220;that side of the argument.&#8221; No decision makers have confirmed this to be a security issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:35\">second response</a> on the ticket evades the questions plugin developers are asking and instead states that the availability of an API for this data was never promised: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>As has been pointed out, there was never an API made for public use or with any promise of availability, people just reverse engineered and exfiltrated the data to create the chart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I definitely think we can show some more stats to plugin authors about their own plugins, and I&#8217;m hearing that for newer plugins every new install can be a motivator. Feedback loops are important. It will take some work but it&#8217;s doable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While he seems open to finding a way to show more stats, Mullenweg did not promise the return of the active install growth data, the most important metric for plugin authors tracking the trajectory of their user bases. Many businesses rely on this data to make product decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think that one of the main things (from my perspective) is that this change has made us feel vulnerable and powerless,&#8221; WordPress plugin author Ross Morsali <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rmors_/status/1577612513256116224\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m about to change a repo based on three years of work, and I won&#8217;t even know how it does until I lose or gain at least 10,000 users. Feels kind of insane, not a good foundation for my business.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morsali <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:41\">commented</a> on the ticket to explain the importance of the data:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>It is literally the only way to know how your plugin is doing &#8211; which in itself, is pretty bad &#8211; the removal of it just put blindfolds on everyone &#8211; so we have to wait until the next tick of install growth (up or down) to get any idea &#8211; it&#8217;s not reasonable &#8211; this can take 6 months or more in some cases, and literally forever if your plugin is neither going up or down in active installs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants in the discussion on trac were so inflamed that one suggested plugin developers should strike by offering no more support, updates, or new plugins to the directory unless WordPress brings back the growth charts. This simply isn&#8217;t possible for the many people who make a living from their plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As someone who is in the early days of trying to grow a freemium plugin, I&#8217;m incredibly frustrated,&#8221; Equalize Digital CEO Amber Hinds <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heyamberhinds/status/1577651286970929159\">said</a>. &#8220;We were using that as one way to gauge the efficacy of our marketing efforts and now it&#8217;s just gone. Also, in investor conversations being able to show growth is vital.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>George Stephanis, an Automattic employee who was not involved in the decision, <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:60\">claims</a> that, &#8220;This chart was removed&nbsp;due to a Security or Privacy concern,&#8221; and speculates that it hasn&#8217;t been disclosed yet because it can&#8217;t be shared without putting users at risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It was never explicitly stated it was removed for a security or privacy concern,&#8221; Earle Davies <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:61\">said</a> in response to this claim. &#8220;It was removed due to &#8216;due to insufficient data obfuscation&#8217; which to me does not mean security or privacy. Privacy is PII which this chart did not include. The obfuscation is because &#8216;we&#8217; (whoever we is) did not want people to be able to see &#8216;exact&#8217; stats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Framing a summation of this as a privacy or security update isn&#8217;t accurate. What may be most useful is if Matt stops flying by with 1-2 sentence non-answers and finally addresses in detail and plain language WHY this was removed. Short of that it should be reinstated ASAP and work on better charts in the future.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress plugin developers may never know the details behind this chart&#8217;s removal. If it is in fact a security issue, this could have been confirmed in a transparent way by the people involved. Instead, plugin developers have been set on edge by the demand that they present their side of the argument for bringing back the stats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark Zahra, the author of the ticket to bring the stats back, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markzahra/status/1577599271045586949\">tweeted</a> to bring attention to how many people are following the ticket and invested in its outcome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Even if 10,000 people commented and appeared to agree that would still be a small fraction of the wider WP community,&#8221; Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1577739784453124096\">responded</a>. &#8220;That’s one of the hardest things to navigate in open source, and product and community development generally.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This reaction drew the ire and frustration of those hoping for some real answers. It also makes it exquisitely clear who has the power in this situation, whether to withhold information or turn off access to data. Despite overwhelming consensus on the ticket from the people impacted the most by this decision, 10,000 wouldn&#8217;t be enough to wield any influence over the outcome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, the protracted lack of transparency in this matter has further damaged trust in WordPress.org as the best distribution channel for free plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The way that this has been dealt with has made me seriously question if WordPress is the right platform for me, for the first time in years &#8211; it&#8217;s made me and my business feel vulnerable,&#8221; Morsali said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Oct 2022 04:13:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: #45 – Alex Ball on Customizing Core Blocks for Clients\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=138304\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/45-alex-ball-on-customizing-core-blocks-for-clients\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38261:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] Nathan Wrigley: Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things, WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, making it easier for clients to use the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m very keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head over to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Alex Ball. Alex is a lead software engineer at Mindgrub, a digital agency in Baltimore, Maryland. He&#8217;s been there for over three years, during which he&#8217;s worked on headless implementations, multinational multi-site installations, and much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to joining Mindgrub, Alex worked in-house for a company handling a suite of internal intranet type sites, and external marketing lead generation sites. He spent seven years at Baltimore magazine on the editorial staff, before managing their website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His website leadership experience continues to inform his decision making today. Especially for training clients and making the block editor as easy to use as possible. And that, in essence is the subject of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During WordCamp US 2022, Alex gave a lightning talk in which he laid out some suggestions on how the block editor can be made more straightforward for clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most regular WordPress users have become accustomed to the way that the block editor works. Over time, we&#8217;ve understood how things work and where we need to go in the UI to alter things. For many clients, this familiarity simply does not exist. The editor is new and perhaps confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the block editor is under constant revision, this can create confusion, and lead to mistakes. Add to that the fact that more and more of the website can now be modified inside the editor, and it&#8217;s easy to see how mistakes can be made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex talks about solutions to this problem, and he comes at it from different angles. Maybe you lock certain features down so that only certain users can achieve specific tasks. Or it might be that you need to take some time to educate your clients more about the block editor and how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically when we record the podcast, there&#8217;s not a lot of background noise, but that&#8217;s not always the case. Over the coming weeks, I&#8217;ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artifacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listable, I hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to WP tavern.com. Forward slash podcast. And you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you, Alex Ball.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Alex Ball. How are you doing, Alex?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:07] Alex Ball: Very well, thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:09] Nathan Wrigley: We are at WordCamp US 2022. We&#8217;re sitting in the media room, and Alex has joined me today to have a little bit of conversation about block patterns and blocks and locking blocks and all of those kind of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll get into that in a moment, but Alex, just give us a little bit of background. Tell us about yourself, your journey with WordPress. How is it that you&#8217;re at a WordCamp, talking to a bunch of people in your presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:31] Alex Ball: Sure. So I started with WordPress probably in 2007 or so. And at that point I was not a developer, I was an English major. I had been on the editorial staff of our city magazine in Baltimore, Baltimore Magazine for seven years, and people knew what the internet was at that time and we didn&#8217;t have a very good site and we needed one. And I somehow talked leadership into letting me take over the site without any of that development experience that was probably critical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, I dove right in and got used to it and followed some tutorials for building a WordPress theme from scratch, and just took off from there. So I, I was there for another four years. I worked at another company that had quite a few websites, both internal and external.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they were across a number of different states in the US, and so working with those, using WordPress on quite a few of them. Landing pages, some internal intranet type things. And then I found Mind Grub, and I&#8217;ve been with Mind Grub for three and a half years, and we do all sorts of things from really large enterprise scale things hosted on WordPress VIP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do headless installations with a React single page app front end. We do more structured data sort of things where Gutenberg is really not a consideration because of all the structured data that&#8217;s going on there. And we have a pretty excellent WordPress team, and so it&#8217;s been really beneficial for me to try to carve out that path within our team and help us move forward with Gutenberg because we&#8217;ve heard from Matt Mullenweg more than once that Gutenberg is the future of WordPress. That you&#8217;re going to need to know JavaScript to work with WordPress in depth, and that when people ask him at WordCamp about the sites that they still have with the classic editor plugin running, and what they need to do about that and when they&#8217;ll need to switch those over, he says you&#8217;re going to need to switch those over at some point,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:02] Nathan Wrigley: At Mind Grub, is that a decision that you made more recently, or are we going back several years? You&#8217;re exclusively using Gutenberg with a variety of different blocks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:11] Alex Ball: We are, no, I would not say we&#8217;re exclusively using Gutenberg. It still depends on the site, and we still do raise the prospect of it with a client at the beginning of a project. We find that some clients are aware of it, and really don&#8217;t want to use it. We&#8217;ve had that reaction so we just go with that and we use the classic editor plugin and we move on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have found that most of the time they&#8217;re not familiar with it, and so they don&#8217;t care one way or another. And when we tell them it&#8217;s a more enhanced, what you see is what you get editing experience with more ability to move things around and know what you&#8217;re doing before you hit save, that they like the sound of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We occasionally have people who say that they&#8217;ve heard of it and do want to use it. And I guess those are the three real possibilities there. So, in large part it is we&#8217;re moving forward with it and doing that because we know it&#8217;s the future, it&#8217;s going to be better for the client and they do not have a strong preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:20] Nathan Wrigley: So you are here and you are giving a presentation. I say giving, maybe you&#8217;ve already given.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:25] Alex Ball: I have given it, yes. It was about an hour ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] Nathan Wrigley: How did it go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:29] Alex Ball: I thought it went well. It was a lightning talk and it was about modifying or customizing core blocks for clients. And I used a metaphor about setting guardrails for clients, that I believe was also recently spoken on your podcast with another guest who used the same phrase, and I heard that one after I had made my submission. But I thought it went well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a lightning talk and so it was really focused on the nitty gritty of using a few blocks as examples, core blocks that are probably the most used blocks. Heading, paragraph, image, button, and talking about the specific options that they present for modifying their output and their appearance. And how to go about doing that. And in some cases it was using PHP to do some things. In some cases it&#8217;s enqueuing some admin scripts. And in a lot of the cases it&#8217;s using the theme dot json file, which not everyone is totally familiar with at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:41] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so it was called customizing core blocks for clients. And forgive me, I was not present at your talk, I may be ill prepared with this question, but it felt from the show notes that you shared with me, the things that you thought it would be good to talk about. The principle of the talk was how to lock things down in a website, so that you could build things and then be fairly sure that when you hand it over, there&#8217;s not gonna be that moment where they phone you 24 hours later to say, it no longer looks the same. We&#8217;ve had a bit of a play. We thought we knew what we were doing, and sadly we need you to fix what we just broke. That&#8217;s the principle, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:20] Alex Ball: Right, Exactly. And you find that the nice thing about working with WordPress is that someone on the client team, when you start the project is already familiar with it. Someone has worked with WordPress in the past. Maybe the site that they&#8217;re replacing is a WordPress site. So they&#8217;re somewhat familiar with it, even if they&#8217;re not familiar with the block editor yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And before I even get into developing and writing the theme, there&#8217;s already been a large process with our design and UX teams designing the site, and those stakeholders, the client, are sitting in these meetings reviewing those designs, exploring design ideas early on to establish things that they like and don&#8217;t like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of time spent on that design, and there&#8217;s a lot of thought that goes into it. From a design perspective, the colors that they choose to compliment one another, the fonts that they choose, the UX decisions for what type of menu it might be, how this might look with this. And so all of that work is being done, and the client is obviously paying for that. So it&#8217;s important to make sure that that is consistent throughout the development process and after you&#8217;ve handed the site off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully when we do a project, we are creating a relationship with this client and not just simply handing over a site and waving goodbye to them. So, it&#8217;s important to make sure that they feel like they have the control that they need to do what they want to do on the site, but not to feel like anything they touch is going to break something or look bad or go way outside the bounds of this design system that has been carefully crafted for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:14] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m pretty sure that 99% of the people listening to this podcast will know exactly what the Gutenberg UI looks like. They can drop paragraph blocks in and they can drop various other bits and pieces in. But in your presentation, the summary of your presentation, you make this point, which is borrowed from somewhere else, I&#8217;m sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you said with great power comes great responsibility. And I guess if you were back in the days of the what we&#8217;re now calling the classic editor, you really didn&#8217;t have any options there. You were just pasting text. There might be some shortcodes being dumped in. And now of course in the era of Gutenberg, there&#8217;s a whole load of things that every single person dropping into a default install of WordPress can change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, there&#8217;s options to change the color of the text, and there&#8217;s options to increase the padding and the margins, and a whole myriad of things in the right hand column. And I guess this is the piece. You&#8217;re trying to make it so that there are constraints in what the clients can alter in the Gutenberg UI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:15] Alex Ball: Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. You also have called your presentation, well you use the phrase customizing core blocks. Why just core blocks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:24] Alex Ball: Well, the reason I went with core blocks is because they&#8217;re obviously present in WordPress at this point, and there&#8217;s no extra work to be done. Everyone has probably seen them in WordPress, even if you have decided to go a different route and install a plugin that gives you some other blocks that you feel you might want some sort of carousel or gallery or something like that, that you like the look of or does what you needed to do. You&#8217;ve still got those core blocks there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So everyone is working with those, that&#8217;s a sort of common denominator. And also because when we talk about being as efficient as possible when building this site and giving the client as much of what they want as we can give them. It makes more sense to start with those core blocks, which are already there. We don&#8217;t have to do any extra work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t have to waste any other time either creating a custom block that&#8217;s essentially reinventing the wheel. They are there, and if there are good ways, and not necessarily easy, but ways to customize them, that makes the most sense for getting these things off the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:41] Nathan Wrigley: If we go back several years, it feels like it&#8217;s quite a long time now, when Gutenberg initially launched, there was a real kind of schism in the community. Many people felt that it wasn&#8217;t fit for purpose at that time. You know, there were limited options. It was all very confusing and so on. I feel like we&#8217;ve crossed that Rubicon now. We&#8217;ve come to the other side and, most people here are familiar with it and working with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, the reason that these third party plugins come along, which drop in the carousel and drop in the accordion and all the other different things, is because there are some fairly big limitations to what core blocks can do. You know, there aren&#8217;t all of the different options and those third party suites are there to fill in that gap. What are your feelings about your ability to create almost any layout with core blocks? Is that now possible?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:30] Alex Ball: Whew. My gut is telling me no. And I think that this was part of that recent controversy that I&#8217;m sort of surface familiar with, where they released a new design on the wordpress.org site for the homepage and the downloads page. And again, referring to something that Matt Mullenweg said, he talked about how it could have been done more quickly than it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he also referred to like Wix and Squarespace and page builders. And it generated obviously a lot of feedback. I think some people were in agreement, and others did not agree. I think that a lot of the sentiment out there was that you could still, with the core blocks available to you, not necessarily go ahead and just do this as easily as people were making it seem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that I had seen something on WP Tavern about a YouTuber who is very, very good with the block editor, and like whipped through in one of his videos, the building that homepage design through the block editor alone, and feeling like he got 95% of the way there pretty quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, speaking to what I&#8217;m most familiar with, which is our projects and the designs that we put together. There has not been a project in the last couple years where we have come up with designs for it and been able to do even more than half of it with just core blocks. I do like to use the core blocks as much as possible for the reasons that we already discussed, but it usually involves quite a bit of custom work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, our designers also know that, and they&#8217;re certainly designing for things. There&#8217;s always that interplay of design and development, and getting a design and explaining why something is a little difficult or might not work with this or that, and going back and forth and collaborating. The main thing I think is that the core blocks have a lot of these options and it&#8217;s sort of like, I think it was the Abraham Lincoln quote, which is, you can please all of the people some of the time, or you can please some of the people all of the time, but you can&#8217;t please all of the people all of the time. And so it just can&#8217;t be all things to all people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:02] Nathan Wrigley: I guess the nice thing about Gutenberg blocks is that they nest. You can put in a block and then inside of that, let&#8217;s say, I don&#8217;t know, it might be a group block or something like that, and then you can nest things. And one of the nested items could be a core block, and then you are going to unlock the ability to modify that core block. Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s a paragraph block or a heading block or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it may be that you&#8217;re doing custom work with the parent blocks, but the bit that you are trying to open up to the client, if you like, may just be a core block, which is a child of that. Have I kind of got where you were describing there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:40] Alex Ball: Yes, that&#8217;s exactly right. And that inner blocks element that you can use either if you&#8217;re building a custom block in React, or if you decide to go the route, we tend to use ACF on a lot of sites, and ACF has a very easy method for creating blocks as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;re not constrained to just using ACF fields on those. You can use that inner blocks element in an ACF block to include a core block or core blocks. And we&#8217;ve definitely done that because again, sometimes you have a core container block, like a columns block that&#8217;s going to give the user a slider that lets them choose the number of columns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don&#8217;t necessarily want that. I wanna use the paragraph block within that, but I don&#8217;t want the ability to slide that thing all the way to the right and, insert a six column layout, because that&#8217;s not gonna look good anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that you nailed it. I think that there is always that combination of some of that custom work, and some of the core blocks that we&#8217;ve already got that make it easier to bootstrap things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:55] Nathan Wrigley: I have a feeling that if we were to have this conversation, I&#8217;m gonna say 24 months. I think if we had the same conversation in 24 months, I&#8217;m imagining that some of the things that you can not achieve at the moment with core blocks, that will have gone, and the layout will be almost entirely possible with core blocks. I certainly know that that&#8217;s the intention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re not quite there yet, but some third party things, I&#8217;m thinking of things like GenerateBlocks and so on at the moment. They&#8217;ve really got the whole, the grid layout and all of that really well defined and sussed out. And I just think it&#8217;s a matter of time, so maybe it would be a moot point in 24 months and we might just be able to skip over that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:32] Alex Ball: I think that you&#8217;re right. I agree with that. I don&#8217;t know if there is an equivalent to Moore&#8217;s law about, you know, how quickly Gutenberg is going to double or whatever to make itself kind of the next version of it. I know that they, well, I think that they think of it in phases. And this imminent third phase, whether it&#8217;s already begun or it&#8217;s about to begin, I&#8217;m not sure, but that&#8217;s sort of the workflow phase, and the emphasis is going to be on collaboration, I believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then after that I think there&#8217;s a roadmap for looking at things like multilingual stuff. So, your framing it like that, looking at it in the future, and some of these issues we&#8217;re talking about today, being obsolete at that point is correct. And I think is hopefully captured by that phased approach that they are talking about</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:27] Nathan Wrigley: In your presentation notes, you mentioned that you are essentially, you are handing over your work to clients. They&#8217;ve paid for their website and you want to mitigate them and you use the word breaking or break. Are the tools for allowing clients to modify this thing, but not this thing. Do they exist in core already? Can you deploy those things or is that custom work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:52] Alex Ball: The answer to that is a hearty, confident, it depends. It would be really nice to be able to get very granular with some of these things and let different roles control different things. There is a little bit of that now. We&#8217;re starting to scratch the surface with that, as I understand it. Since version six, we&#8217;ve got this block locking feature. Now to clarify, before version six, you have the ability to set a template and use that template lock attribute to determine whether the entire template that you&#8217;ve defined is locked down and nothing can be added or moved around, or whether things could be moved within it. That existed already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now what we&#8217;ve got is on the block settings itself, a little lock icon and the ability to do those same things with that block. I wanna lock this block so it can&#8217;t be moved. I want to lock this block so it can&#8217;t be removed. I wanna do both. You can do both of those things now and, I think it is the can lock attribute. I may be wrong on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s an attribute that will let you specify whether a user, based on their role, is able to access that lock setting. Now, that lock setting itself is a little bit rudimentary. We&#8217;re talking about this and we&#8217;re going, Oh man, so only administrators can add the drop cap. We&#8217;re not there yet, as far as I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:27] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. I think at the moment it&#8217;s a case of, and I could be wrong about this, maybe things have moved on. I think it&#8217;s merely a function to lock it for now. It is locked, but I think almost anybody can go and unlock it. The principle, I think, is to lock it just so you don&#8217;t accidentally do something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I feel that the things that you&#8217;ve described, that&#8217;s a real nice roadmap, isn&#8217;t it? The ability to be able to lock things in the UI based upon roles. Who knows, even based upon particular users. And so, almost everything comes into play. So as an example, you are an editor, you can do anything more or less, you know, we&#8217;ve given you real wide scope to move things up and down, change the colors, change the font, change the text, whatever, depending on which block you&#8217;re using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you are a different role. Created a new role for some other person in the organization, and all that they can do is move things up and down. Just that, there&#8217;s no other capabilities. And I feel that all of that is going to come and we&#8217;ll be able to lock people in and out. And at the moment, as you said, it&#8217;s all possible if you are a developer, but the day will come, I&#8217;m hoping that that&#8217;s all possible by non-technical users with the necessary permissions to do that in some kind of UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:39] Alex Ball: Yeah exactly. I feel the same way. And in my talk there&#8217;s a bit of a constraint with time. And so I think it comes off a little bit as feeling like I&#8217;m referring to this sort of monolithic, the client, as this singular entity and it&#8217;s the same everywhere. And obviously it&#8217;s not. Every site is different, every client is different, every client team is different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even beyond that, you could be talking about situations where you had your stakeholders during the project. They loved the designs. They understand what they&#8217;re getting. They understand how to use it. They understand what sort of control they have when they are adding blocks and creating content. And then you have a relationship with them and maybe a maintenance agreement or something, and six months later, they&#8217;ve hired someone new, who was not present to hear about why the designers chose this over this. To hear the rationale behind choosing these button styles over these button styles, and getting all of that background on the design and why it works so well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they do have some assignment to add a CTA to the website, by tomorrow. And they want it to stand out. And the controls are right there on this button block to choose any color they want for the text and any color they want for the background. And they go ahead and do that. And then you hear from the supervisor, the person that you&#8217;ve been working with, who says, we establish this color palette. How were we able to go so far outside that with hot pink. And also, this person didn&#8217;t choose an accessible contrast ratio between the button text and the button background colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can imagine all these different situations where even though you accounted for some of these things, and even though there was a bit of that uncertainty and agreement with the client that you can do this, but you shouldn&#8217;t. There are still situations that maybe you didn&#8217;t account for that will allow them to go outside the bounds of what was really intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the counter argument, I suppose, is probably it is their website, and they did pay for all this and it&#8217;s theirs. And if they decide they wanna do that, they can. And I guess the only real response to that is that that is fine. It is your site and we&#8217;re happy to help you with it. But when you run into these issues that occur because of all that control and your willingness to change these things, then there&#8217;s only so much we can do. And if you decide that you want us at that point to put some limitations on there, then we will be happy to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:32] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, there really is no perfect answer to this question is there? There is just what that particular client is willing to negotiate. And it may be that a particular client just wants nothing to do with it and wants to write you email. Every time they want to make a modification, the email comes in and you do it. So they don&#8217;t need any permissions of any kind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are gonna be the others who are gonna want everything available to them and potentially do a wonderful job, but potentially really be on the phone a lot, asking you to fix things. And I guess there&#8217;s a job of figuring out the contracts, and working out, okay, if I give you this permission, that&#8217;s fine, but, I don&#8217;t know, here&#8217;s our hourly rate when things go pear shaped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:13] Alex Ball: Yes. and we are not the HOA president who is out here to walk the neighborhood and point out the mortar color in their bricks, that is not an HOA approved mortar color. That&#8217;s not us. So I would go back to what I said before where it&#8217;s, I hope we are establishing a relationship with the client and that part of that is that collaborative nature and that understanding with them of what they&#8217;re getting and what can be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we do tend to have projects regularly where there is training with the client built in, and that is really helpful. Because we&#8217;re able to do a walkthrough with them and explain these things, and have them point out things that maybe they&#8217;ve already been in there doing content management, and we&#8217;re running into something with this or that. And then we&#8217;re also able to provide them with documentation that they can continue to refer to. And that is obviously a great opportunity to discuss all of these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:14] Nathan Wrigley: How granular have you gone with this in the past? Have you handed over websites where there&#8217;s been literally dozens of users or user roles where they&#8217;ve got, this particular user role can do these myriad of things and this other user role can just do far less? Have you really explored this a lot and found it to be fruitful?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:31] Alex Ball: I wouldn&#8217;t say that we have had, or at least that come to my mind right now, too many sites where we have many, many different user roles. You certainly run into sites where there needs to be some sort of editorial workflow and approval process. And I think that that, for the most part, handles those sorts of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also think that, where we are right now with the block editor, in the future we are more likely to be able to handle some of these things on a role by role basis. Whereas right now it is a little bit more difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:12] Nathan Wrigley: You mentioned training and that&#8217;s a big part. How to describe it? I think it can be quite a tiresome thing to create the training because, on some level you just want the website to be finished and you want to hand it over. But I guess if you are handing over a website based on Gutenberg, and the clients have never seen this before. Creating training materials, being on hand, going to their premises and demonstrating it to them, or creating videos and putting those somewhere. I guess that&#8217;s an important part in this puzzle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:39] Alex Ball: Yes, yes. We tend to record those training sessions, those, uh, Zoom calls where we&#8217;re walking through it and screen sharing. And we did recently go through the documentation, that sort of, starter framework of that documentation, and revise it and go through some of the things that we&#8217;ve got in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then obviously every site gets a few different, not even appendices, but main sections. There&#8217;s a table of contents and you go through some of the basics of WordPress, but then you delve into some of those custom blocks and sometimes they really need some extra documentation over exactly what each feature does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you&#8217;ve got the different fields labeled and you&#8217;ve got descriptions on those labels. But it really helps them to have that documentation to refer to as well, explaining why this happens. Why when I click this, this other conditional field disappears. And it&#8217;s because if you do it this way, you&#8217;re not going to have access to this or vice versa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The documentation and the training is not part of every project, but when it is, a lot of the things that we&#8217;ve talked about can come up and be worked through, and for the most part solved, or at least established what lines are where.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:04] Nathan Wrigley: You mentioned at the beginning that you weren&#8217;t a developer. You&#8217;ve sort of grown into that role. And I imagine there&#8217;s several people listening to this who have played with blocks in the UI. They&#8217;ve dragged things in and they&#8217;ve modified what&#8217;s available to them there and, that&#8217;s great. But if they want to start tinkering with blocks and they want to alter what the capabilities are with the blocks, the core blocks, whichever block it may be. What are the kind of things that they need to be interested in? Where do they need to be going? What are the documents that they need to read? What are the technologies they need to understand?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:35] Alex Ball: That&#8217;s a very good question. I, a few years ago at WordCamp, did another talk where I talked about coding like a writer, and it was trying to give those non-technical content people more confidence in diving into the code a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s modifying the attributes on a short code. You know, you&#8217;ve cut and pasted from documentation from the plugin that provides that short code. But you&#8217;re starting to look at that and realize that these different little attributes within those brackets do different things. And what happens if I do this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Delving into the html behind the scenes a little bit. Getting your feet wet and all that. And I used principles that you would adhere to in writing and also try to adhere to in coding, to get them to feel more comfortable doing what I think you were describing, which is getting into that code a little bit and not simply staying on the surface with just the UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was things like don&#8217;t repeat yourself, which is obviously a massively important axiom in engineering. It was things like, get to the point as quickly as possible. It was things like writing good documentation. Commenting the things that you are adding to the code so that other people know what it means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the closest thing to that sort of pure editorial writing that I touched on. And, so I think that hopefully people felt a little bit empowered by that to go, Oh, okay, well, right. So this is the way I would approach the lead in my story. And so this is how I&#8217;m going to approach the template on this page or the way I structure these blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:33] Nathan Wrigley: When you began your work on blocks, were there any places that you found to be particularly useful that helped you understand the technologies behind? Because it is a big, it is a big change. If you&#8217;ve been working with PHP for the last 20 years, not really wanted to stray away from there, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot to be learned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m imagining that you&#8217;ve found better places than others, shall we say. What are some of the resources that you have enjoyed using that you would recommend to others, should they be interested in this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:00] Alex Ball: The first one that comes to mind that I think I hit on pretty regularly as I was learning was Bill Erickson&#8217;s website. He&#8217;s got a lot of good information and it appears pretty high up in most Google results. So it shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to suss out his information on it. But obviously going to his site and looking through things tagged as Gutenberg should do the trick as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and I mean obviously Stack Overflow, so much information on there. There is a trainer online named Zach Gordon, who does a lot of JavaScript based training, which is what you&#8217;re going to need to deal with, if you are starting to create those custom blocks and you&#8217;re not going to use some sort of scaffolding or use that Advanced Custom Fields approach to building them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember using one of his courses to dive into some of that and get a lot of good information from him. And, along the way we started modifying that starter theme that we use for projects to make it easier to build it into a, a block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:14] Nathan Wrigley: Alex Ball, thank you so much for joining us on the podcast today. It&#8217;s been a real pleasure chatting to you about blocks and locking them down and so on and so forth. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:22] Alex Ball: No, thank you. It has been my pleasure.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Alex Ball.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex is a Lead Software Engineer at <a href=\"https://www.mindgrub.com/\">Mindgrub</a>, a digital agency in Baltimore, Maryland. He’s been there for over three years, during which he’s worked on headless implementations, multinational multisite installations, and much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to joining Mindgrub, Alex worked in-house for a company handling a suite of internal intranet-type sites and external marketing lead-generation sites. He spent seven years at Baltimore magazine on the editorial staff before managing their website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His website leadership experience continues to inform his decision-making today, especially for training clients and making the block editor as easy to use as possible, and that, in essence, is the subject of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During WordCamp US 2022, Alex gave a lightning talk in which he laid out some suggestions on how the block editor can be made more straightforward for clients. Most regular WordPress users have become accustomed to the way the block editor works. Over time, we’ve understood how things work and where we need to go in the UI to alter things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many clients, this familiarity simply does not exist. The editor is new and perhaps confusing. As the block editor is under constant revision, this can create confusion and lead to mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add to that the fact that more and more of the website can now be modified inside the editor, and it’s easy to see how mistakes can be made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex talks about solutions to this problem, and he comes at it from different angles. Maybe you lock certain features down so that only certain users can achieve specific tasks.

Over the coming weeks, I’ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artefacts.

This release also improves selection of multiple blocks, making it smoother and more consistent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most impactful improvements to the writing flow is that the editor now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44083\">hides all floating block UI</a> while the user is typing. Gutenberg engineer Michal Czaplinski demonstrated these updates in a video:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Version 14.2 adds support for kerning controls in the Global Styles panel, making it possible for users to adjust the letter spacing with live preview in the editor. Gutenberg contributor Robert Anderson, who submitted the PR for this feature, advocated for getting it into the upcoming 6.1 release. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t technically a &#8216;bug&#8217; (more &#8216;missing functionality&#8217;) but it (along with <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44067\">#44067</a>) does make global styles feel less broken,&#8221; Anderson said. 15 days ago the feature was cherry-picked and added to the wp/6.1 branch to have it included in the next release.</p>\n\n\n\nvideo source: Gutenberg <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44142#pullrequestreview-1108485369\">PR #44142</a>\n\n\n\n<p>A few other notable improvements in version 14.2 include the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>New Calendar block settings for adding the background, link, and text color</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“Banners” and “Footers” added to block pattern categories</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Autocompletion for links is now available in any block using the <code>[[</code> shortcut to trigger it in the editor</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg developers also discovered that they recently introduced a bug when improving the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/01/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-0-31-august/#highlight-1\">List block to use inner blocks</a>, where it would re-render for each level of nesting. Fixing this problem brought significant performance gains for the initial load of the editor.

Challenges arose with reliable project management on the agency side while they tried to establish a foothold in the WordPress plugin market after a first attempt with themes. The WooCommerce Extensions Store is where their business took off. With niche extensions that had no competition, they ranked very quickly. Other ideas for plugins solved problems in custom development projects for clients. Eventually, the Keiths developed a formula for evaluating new plugin ideas. Learn from their challenges and successes — there are a lot of interesting details that only come from experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-51 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-50 wp-block-columns sponsor has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"StellarWP\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-48 wp-block-column\">\n<h3 class=\"StellarWP has-theme-palette-1-color has-text-color\" id=\"Sponsor\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <span><a href=\"https://poststat.us/elementor\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">Elementor</a></span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elementor </strong>enables web creators to build professional, pixel-perfect websites with an intuitive visual builder.

I\'m talking to one of our great post status members, Katie. Keith. I got to meet her in person a couple weeks ago at work camp US in San Diego, and got a little bit about her story there and she\'s got so many compelling things to part of her story that\'s gonna be valuable to our audience and our membership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, particularly how do you go from client service and agency? To successful plug-in business, particularly, you\'re gonna hear all those stories about, um, Katie and her work and her team\'s work at Barn two. But Katie, thank you for, um, coming on, uh, post draft today and being willing to share your story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Thank you for having me. Okay, so tell us a little bit about yourself. You\'re the co-founder of Barn Two, but I want to give you an opportunity to just kinda say a little bit about yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Um, yeah, so I\'m Katie. Um, kind of one of the two directors at Barn, two plugins. I run [00:01:00] the company with my husband Andy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we\'re English, but last year we moved to, uh, New Yorker, Spain, um, because of the flexibility you get with this industry, which is amazing. Um, So that\'s kind of what\'s new with me at the moment and new country to live in. And we have a kind of a team around the world. So, um, we were able to work from anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> awesome. Um, and we could talk about New York all the time cause I remember you mentioned that and I love that, uh, story. But I\'m gonna stay the topic here today. Well, so tell us about, Okay. Currently today, um, Your business is primarily around plugins, but WooCommerce plugins, and I wanna get to that, but I wanna talk about the story of the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, mm-hmm. , you, you and your husband started in 2009, but could you tell us the story about how you started in web design and development and WordPress and all that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Yeah, sure. So, um, Most of the [00:02:00] time when in, when we were in our twenties, we had normal jobs, um, both in the public sector in England, and we would always talk about we wanting to run a business together and we never did it for ages and ages and, um, just kept taking our salaries and not doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then eventually, um, Andy in particular was, um, quite fed up with his job and so we thought, Right, we\'re gonna take the plunge and do something. And we couldn\'t afford for us both to do it. So he quit his job and I kept my job and we started freelancing together, basically building websites. Uh, we thought that was a fairly easy thing to get into because, um, you can attract quite small clients and work your way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, he\'s a software developer and did the technical stuff and I have a marketing and project management background, so I managed the clients and did their SEO and content and everything. So it worked quite well as, um, something we could do together. So we started freelancing, um, fairly quickly. We [00:03:00] discovered WordPress as being the best way to build a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So all our projects were built on WordPress. Um, it wasn\'t something the clients were asking for, that was just our decision. And then after about a year, I thought, Well, what if I actually advertised this as WordPress specialists? So this was in late 2010. So I ran a Google AdWords campaign focusing on keywords like WordPress experts and things like that, and it was amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We. I think I spent 3000, uh, probably pounds, and we got within couple of weeks, more than 10,000 pounds worth of work out of it. I realized it\'s not that easy now because there\'s a lot of WordPress specialists, but back then there was a gap that we kind of fell on, and so the agency grew from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay, so then you\'re, and then you were able to come full time at some point, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, what, what happened? So you, you found WordPress, you started to build this, and how did the next [00:04:00] couple of months, years or whatever until, um, the plugins go, what were you, you were just, you were building websites and all the things around it. Did it get, did it broaden out to anything specialization wise, or?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How did that grow? Grow from there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Yeah, we specialized in doing more bespoke, uh, client projects in WordPress because we\'d found this gap that there was at the time. And we recruited a team of freelancers, um, from websites like Upwork, which wasn\'t called Upwork then, and people per hour and found good people and, you know, we thoroughly vet them and things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we managed to build a freelance team. We didn\'t have any employees or anything. Everybody was just freelance. And that way we could increase capacity. We were really pleased at first that we were running our own business. We quit our jobs, and that was really great. And then we started to think, actually, it\'s still kind of not the perfect lifestyle because clients work, [00:05:00] as I\'m sure all your listeners know, can be quite demanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They want things done straight away. They have problems with their website, which you have to sort out immediately and you don\'t really get any time. So we have that in the back of our minds that what is the ultimate sort of lifestyle type business where we can be successful and have that flexibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And being in the WordPress industry, we could see that WordPress products and the growth of that. And, um, at the time you could see how well people were doing with themes, particularly, um, on theme forest. So in about 2013 we spent like literally a year building a theme, which we were gonna spend on sell on theme forest, and it was rejected, so that was disappointing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we spent so long building this product that in the time we were doing so that market changed and it became very competitive with the big themes like Avada and Jupiter coming out, uh, which were huge [00:06:00] pieces of software, uh, with tons and tons of features, which we. Possibly do, um, ourselves. So we kind of gave up on that idea for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and then in, but in 2016, we thought, let\'s go down the plugin route because plugins can be small and very niche, or do I have to say niche, um, . Um, and so we launched our first plugin, um, and um, it went from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay, so let\'s back up just a second. So, started themes, what was the, was the desire there to kind of diversify income, explore this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you have, you obviously had some time to be able to, like your, your agency work is going well and start to, Okay. Hey, how, how did the product and the themes, uh, idea kind of get started and, and what were your thoughts around that? Like,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> We found the capacity to develop it, um, through the freelance team so that [00:07:00] they didn\'t do the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, they did the client projects and that freed up Andy as the technical director to work on the side projects. So because we had people that we could outsource the technical side of projects, Two, he was able to do that. And then I was able to take over the marketing when things were launched. And so that was, um, if it was just him doing all the client projects, that would\'ve been very difficult because he, you get dragged onto those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, whenever something urgent happens or he, you need some money, then you\'d end up doing the work yourself. So through the, um, freelance team, that was helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I feel like I hear a lot of stories where it\'s, you get up to kind of cruising that altitude and you\'re able to have just a little bit more time and space to go, Huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What else would we like to do? Um, you mentioned lifestyle in a second ago, but what was the spark that goes, Okay, maybe if this is true, we had one more time in space where [00:08:00] Andy, for instance, in this scenario, Do that more. What was the spark that led to that? That initial theme product? The</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> spark was that we reached a ceiling in the growth that we were realistically able to achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we had taken on a lot more risk and full-time staff and gone down a much more traditional company model, then we could have continued to grow. But basically the limit we faced was project management. So we found good people that could do design websites and plugins for us, for our clients more specifically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but whenever we tried to find project managers, it didn\'t work. And I spent a long time training some freelance project managers and they just didn\'t have the WordPress experience, the relationship with the clients as I did in. Managing myself. Um, so, and the clients were less happy. Um, and one time [00:09:00] in 2015, um, it, our daughter was just about to start school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as you will know, that holidays get very expensive when your child\'s at school. So before that, we decided to take a month off. And we hired a motor home and drove around France for a month, and that meant we had to take a step back from work. And I got one of my project managers to handle everything, and it was a disaster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clients were unhappy, projects failed. It just didn\'t work. And it became clear that that was the ceiling I had to manage all the project. Um, I obviously didn\'t have the skills to recruit and train project managers. I know some people are good at that, but I wasn\'t. And, um, so we couldn\'t grow any further because I couldn\'t manage any additional projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so then we started thinking, how can we grow, uh, products?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I see. I, I love how you described it as ceiling, cuz I can totally see that, you know, you get to a point where, kind of a fourth in road too of what do you, [00:10:00] what do you wanna do? And we feel like we\'re right here. So that\'s, that\'s, that\'s inspiring too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, okay, so we had the same product and that didn\'t go well. We, you sp said you spent about a year doing that. Um, and then we get over to plugins. I think you said two. 16. But I, I hear from a lot of, um, agencies that have transitioned or offer products that often they start as, uh, client work and you go, Oh, it\'s a discovery of there\'s a need here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how did the plugins and I wanna talk about, and actually talk about what the plugins are, but how did that, uh, spark get started there too with the plugin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Um, well, we launched two plugins very early on. One of them we got the idea from the WooCommerce Ideas forum, where you can publicly see where the gaps in the market are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we just went through the list by the number of votes and found the idea that was, had the most votes. That was realistic for us to develop. So, um, that was our first [00:11:00] plugin, which was called WooCommerce, Password Protected Categories. So it was very simple. It loads of people wanted it, there was nothing at the time that did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it just lets you password protected category for your store. Like if you wanna create a, a hidden area in your shop for members or wholesalers or. So we launched that and our other initial plugin, we got the idea from a client. So this client, uh, hired us to create a searchable table for his blog. So he had hundreds of blog posts about this spiritual leader that he followed, and they wrote all these things about his teachings and things, and there was this massive blog and he wanted a much more searchable, filterable, indexable way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Than a normal WordPress blog where you just have the posts in reverse chronological order. That wasn\'t how he wanted it to be. And so we built this j query table plugin for the client, which he obviously paid us for. And then [00:12:00] independently we built it into a sellable plugin. So we, uh, added a lot more features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We added settings, pages, the kind of things that you wouldn\'t realistically do on a client level project. So we put a lot more into. But the original idea came from this client. Um, we actually released that as a free plugin, which is still available on webpress.org now. It\'s called Post Table with Search and Sort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s basically the, um, bells and whistles version of what we did for the client. Um, but then once we\'d released the free plugin, we started to get feature requests. As you do when you put something out there. So people started asking for two key things. One was the ability to create a searchable table of custom post types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that might be documents or members or articles, videos, audio, all these sorts of custom post types. Um, And the other was specifically W commerce products. So later in 2016 we built our [00:13:00] post table pro plugin, which lists custom post types in a searchable table and our product table plugin W Commerce product table, which takes your W Commerce products and puts them in like a.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Table, which is basically a one page order form. So that works really well because you\'ve got your variations and your quantity boxes and add to cart buttons all on this one page order form. So it\'s, even though it looks the same as the original table of blog posts. So it\'s actually a totally different purpose because it\'s an eCommerce order form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but the idea all came from that one client. And both of those projects have always been, those plugins have always been amongst our most successful. And WooCommerce product tables sold something like 1.2 million worth over its lifetime. And it is our biggest, um, lifetime selling plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Oh, that\'s excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, I never asked revenue numbers, but thank you for sharing that, cuz I think that\'s, uh, inspired people to see how [00:14:00] you\'ve come and how it, you know, evolved as a framework for how they can do that in their own world. Um, the back to, so I, I love that kind of little mini story of how that post search table, I\'ve gotta look this up by the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, cuz I think we might need to post that, um, from, From that product came on our client. I hear that a lot and you gave such an amazing, um, example of how something can. Birth out of client work WooCommerce marketplace. You said the other one came from an idea on the Mark WooCommerce ideas place, but did, how did you get to WooCommerce?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Were you doing WooCommerce type projects for clients or did you say, did you just see that this thing called WooCommerce was coming, this big, big thing, or how did. Has it lead you to the marketplace to find that idea?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> We just knew that we commerce was big and we had also heard or felt, I don\'t remember that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, people are more inclined to buy premium [00:15:00] products, premium plugins, when that will make them money. Which makes sense, doesn\'t it? Mm-hmm. . So, uh, we particularly wanted to sell plugins for e for eCommerce because they would be easier to go premium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, I, So for my time at Ithe, um, we built, mostly, we ended up building, we meandered in the path to plugins and then we kind of found our niche was utility plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I always said, um, Hey, we\'re saving people money, time, and things like that. That\'s the stuff you think about, like insurance. I go, I gotta have insurance. Um, but it\'s not sexy. What sexy is making. You know, and, uh, we never got to this part of the making money part. We felt like we were helping people by extension make money and build their business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\'s, it\'s so neat to hear you all saw, okay, this is something that people, if you help make them money, it\'s a really good thing. Cuz I said, Hey, nobody grabs about the bill of something that, like if you have your [00:16:00] PPC campaign or whatever going and it\'s convert. . Nobody complains much about that Bill, but you complain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I complain about our, our house insurance bill. You know, we gotta re up our house insurance bill because I don\'t think about like, well I don\'t want a fire to burn the house. I want to take care of itself. But on the other side to make money part is, is always felt easier to make that self. Cuz you\'re not a cost item per se.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re more like, No, this is essential to helping us keep making the money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Okay. And not just for the initial sale either, but for ongoing renewals because obviously most plugin companies now sell annually. And if the customer sees that value coming in from the product, they\'re more likely to keep paying as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we do quite a lot of analysis of our pricing to see what, um, is the best balance between sales. A cost per product and, and the W commerce versions always will justify a higher price than a general WordPress plugin. So, W Commerce Product Table and [00:17:00] Post Table Pro are good examples. Post Table Pro has never been able to justify the same price tag as product table because people are displaying information in a useful way rather than selling something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay, so were, Was there a point. After these two plugins start to have success and maybe others that you do, where you said we\'re, we\'re gonna, we\'re gonna thin down client work and we\'re gonna focus on, um, our, just our product and our plugins side of the business. And how did that, Yeah, how did you get to that decision?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> It happened surprisingly quickly. So we launched our first paid plugin in early March, 2016. And by August we were making decisions, Let\'s stop taking on new clients. So we\'ll follow through on existing projects, ex if existing clients want a new website, we\'ll do it. So we kind of slowed it down gradually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So by then the plugins were probably making, I dunno, [00:18:00] $5,000 a month or something, which was less than the client business, but enough to live on. Um, so we could feel fairly confident. And we also had the safety net of a large number of clients that we were hosting and maintaining their websites. So we kind felt that we could take that risk and not be, keep taking up our time building new client projects surprisingly quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So I\'m sure looking back, it feels like a magical time. It was for me when you go, Okay, this thing that we did, Is working and there\'s another opportunity here to, uh, you mentioned lifestyle in, in the beginning here is, and, and that\'s what motivated me too, is always to have this, Oh, this is working. Where could it lead?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it feels, it feels magical to me, but how, how does that, reflecting back in 2016, those six months or so, from. Wow, this could actually be a thing. Oh, this is, oh, we should make these [00:19:00] decisions to do this. Reflecting back, how does that whole time period, uh, feel and how do you think about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Well, the first sale was amazing cuz we just, so we used our existing website, which was@thetimebantu.co uk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We eventually went to bantu.com but that took years. Um, so we had quite good SEO from the client business, so we didn\'t want us. Start again with a new domain or anything. So we put up a, a plugin section on our agency website. So we were advertising web design services and plugins on, you know, different menu tabs, basically, um, added some blog posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because our first plugin, we commerce password protected categories was unique in the market, uh, there was no competition and we ranked very quickly. Which was amazing. And so, um, it actually was literally a few days before the first sale came and we were like, What? We saw this email, new plugin sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s not one of our [00:20:00] tests. That\'s a real person. Oh my God. And we didn\'t even know it would ever sell. Um, so the first sale was really interesting because that\'s the first kind of evidence that people might actually find our website that way and buy things on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> That\'s awesome. Okay, let\'s fast forward a little bit to today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you, what do you offer and what are you doing with Barn two? Let\'s see, what if I\'m doing my math? Six plus years later, almost six years later, you\'re kind of coming up, You\'re already past your anniversary of that big decision. Now what? What are you doing at Barn two? Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> so kind of more of the same really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we\'ve taken what worked and kept doing it. Um, we now have 19 premium plugins, plus maybe four or five free ones. And we have a team of about 14 people, um, who are all, um, working independently around the world. Um, [00:21:00] so from their, their. Uh, so we\'ve got like a support team and a development team and a marketing team, which is amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but ultimately we are just trying to kind of replicate what we started and scale it up cuz it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, it, it for sure did. Congratulations on your success and what you built so far today. Um, it\'s uh, I think a lot of people dream, Oh, I\'d like where Katie is now. That\'s where I want to be. And how do you get there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think you\'ve shared so many key parts to the story. Definitely resonate with me, um, about building product, business. And I go back to what you. Find what works, keep doing it and if it stops working, find something else that\'s working and doing that. Um, I know we talked about some of the original ideas that came from Woo Marketplace looking in, seeing, seeing an opportunity there, and the other side was clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any other thoughts about how, how you go about, or how someone else could go about finding the opportunities for [00:22:00] products as they\'re building their.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Just keep it in mind really, the information, the insights are probably there. If you are in the WordPress industry, you\'re doing projects, you\'re building websites for people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would be surprised if you weren\'t coming across gaps in the market. And, um, if you do a bit of research, you can find out if other people are looking for the same thing that your client has found that doesn\'t exist. Maybe you\'ve recently done some custom code and customization for, I dunno, the events calendar or something that what, there wasn\'t a feature built in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you\'ve written something bespoke that might be a plug-in idea for an extension you could sell. Um, there\'s tons of things like that in all the major plugins, um, like eCommerce. Easy digital downloads, gravity forms and so on. There\'s all these gaps. So if you are using these tools and customizing them, there\'s then to have a think about whether that\'s a product idea,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> it, it\'s part of your experience, part of your expertise, and seems [00:23:00] like a good place to start for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, when we started, I think we started with themes. And, uh, eventually we got into plugins because it was, it was definitely part of conversations I was having, uh, seeing that there was this opportunity with plugins, but it came out of a need for us in those, Just listening to customers, like you\'re saying, is just.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the things that people are bumping into that are problems that probably are valuable if you can solve those problems, Like your, um, your custom posts searched and organized plugin came out of that one person with this massive site. And then did you start asking like, what were the questions you started asking for me with, for instance, back, but when that, that was not my idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It came from our team and I go, Oh, a backup. Click in. My first question was, everybody needs a backup of their web WordPress website that came out of our own pain. Um, but where were some of those questions you started asking as you determine like, this [00:24:00] is feasible for us to take time, resources, energy, You know, I, we\'ll talk about like getting things off the ground to, from a marketing side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know, um, too, because I want to tap into that experience you have and expertise. But, um, what were some of those questions you asked when you\'re like, How do I. How do I determine, make this decision? This is worth some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Well, to be honest, we did had a lot of randomness and luck and instincts. We weren\'t brilliant at establishing that data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we\'ve worked a lot with ellipses to reduce randomness. Um, you know, the marketing company for WordPress, uh, product companies, sis, and, um, because we. Checking that it didn\'t exist. So we were checking, there was a gap, but we weren\'t establishing the, the demand. Sometimes we would just do it because it was new and have a go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so that, yeah, we probably [00:25:00] wasted some resources there. Uh, and um, so that has been an ongoing challenge and not something we\'ve always been brilliant at, but the data is there and if you hire an SEO company or something, you can find out about search volumes or, or just go on Google Trends yourself and see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I love your authenticity though to say that because that\'s so reflective of my own experience and I think of many others. We don\'t just look into it crystal long. Go. There it is. Sure. Maybe that that\'s out there. I have this great idea. I think it would work, but there\'s probably so much backstory to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story I tell often, and so much of this is experiments and over time I tried to make my experiments, uh, cost less and less and less because I made some very expensive. Experiment, failures, you know? Yeah. But I just love your genuineness of saying like, it, we didn\'t have it all together and neither did we, by the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, when you\'re starting and you start to hone that process, like that laboratory process, [00:26:00] I read a book called Little Bets and I back in the day and I go, Oh, I shouldn\'t just go. Um, see an opportunity. Let\'s run for it. Maybe there\'s some nuance there. Uh, one of the mistakes that we made that I often say when people ask me about my failures, particularly in product, I say, uh, I call it, I think it\'s exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in this day, we were seeing the WooCommerce market really grow and explode and, um, it seemed very complex to me, and our opportunities started at, or the, the thought started. There should be a simpler way to do e-commerce for the person actually running the site, putting their products on the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we started, I think, exchange with that kind of premise, but we didn\'t do a lot more thought past that. And it ended up costing us probably 400,000, $500,000 fixed cost. Not to, not to mention opportunity costs. So I use that as my thing. It\'s like, okay, why did I. Why did that fail? Where did we go [00:27:00] wrong?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I\'d say that like there\'s so many failures that get to like, you know, get to, Oh, this is it. But I just keep anchoring back to your client\'s story when they birth out of either your experiences, like you said, or a client that see and like, Oh, could other people use this? How much do they value those things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I sometimes probably get thought, get paralyzed in that over analysis. But there is some here of. Those basic questions of like, is this something that we think could go and going from hunch to actually, let\'s put it out there and test it. Do you have any thoughts around that too? Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> yeah. I\'ve never been a big risk taker and I like small risks, um, that aren\'t like gonna break the bank if they\'re not successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so. The, you know, where we haven\'t established the market first, it wasn\'t a huge amount of development time to get the product out there, for example. Um, we now have a formula which [00:28:00] we use to evaluate new plugin ideas, which looks at factors such as, uh, search volume. Other searches for that, um, concept going up or down, competitiveness, um, difficulty to develop that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we\'ve got this, this whole spreadsheets that we plug new ideas into with some data, so that helps. But yeah, I, I\'ve always been scared of themes because I perceive them as being really huge and a big risk to develop. But you were very brave starting with</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> themes. It was much more complex in two thou. I mean, I\'m sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much more simple in 2008, by the way, than it is today. Um, for for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Cause it was about 2013 that it changed, which is when we were trying to build a theme and suddenly these multipurpose themes flooded the market, didn\'t they?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yes, absolutely. And, and that\'s the other part I think you even mentioned in there is competition is seeing what other people are doing out there in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we did backup Buddy, there wasn\'t really [00:29:00] anything that, what we felt was a holistic backup plugin to do backups, migrations, restoring of websites. And so, but, but again, it was early enough where there wasn\'t a lot. Now, today, totally different story. If we\'re going, we want do a backup plugin, well, There\'s, look at the landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s pretty competitive. The other side, and I love your input on this too, is that so many people, as we the theme market, got so competitive. And people would say, Do you think you could build start, Someone could build, Not even me, just someone could build a theme company. And early on in my, uh, naiveness, I said, um, I don\'t think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it\'d be really, really tough. Well then probably right as, as I say that companies like Beaver Builder come out and I\'m. Wow. Even the competitive, what I viewed as a competitive market, they saw a way to innovate that changed the game. Now they would say, I think [00:30:00] it\'s a plugin versus a theme, but I, But to me, they had a different perspective and they looked at some of what I was buried in complexity and go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, there\'s this, and then, then this whole page builder market starts. Um, and so that\'s always interesting too, is just when I, I, I always say never because when I have said, I don\'t think so, someone ever else goes but here, and it\'s so cool with the innovation that you can do in market. And</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> that\'s an interesting example cuz I think a lot of the, uh, Beaver Builder diehards are developers and people that are quite, uh, into WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and I know that\'s not their whole market, but I think they go more in that direction in terms of their fan base. So they kind of found a bit of a gap as well from say the visual composer types who are very much not that group at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, well, okay, so let\'s, we\'ve talked about kind of getting plugin, evaluating it and all the story that goes a part of that where [00:31:00] Barn two is today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the other compelling question that we talked about before, uh, before we had this, we started recording, was the whole marketing of plugins. Um, and. Particularly, I know this was something that you started with, with the agency back in the day, was your emphasis on marketing too, but how do you think about marketing plugins?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, we\'ve gotten past decision, we\'re building it, we\'ve got it ready to go. And then just that big, broad question of how do you market plugins?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Well because I\'m not a big risk taker, I try to keep it small, but fi cuz with WordPress, in particularly with commerce, small, is a huge market because even the tiniest things there are loads of people searching for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I was going to launch, An events plugin or a membership plugin, I don\'t think I would be that successful, to be honest. Uh, because it\'s so competitive. How are you going to rank for WordPress membership plugin? Never gonna happen, or you\'d have to be very, very good. But [00:32:00] to rank for something really specific that doesn\'t exist in the market is actually quite easy, particularly if you already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say an agency website that you can start selling your products on and blogging on about your products and that you\'ve got some domain authority built up. So my advice, um, if, if you\'ve not got a huge budget and massive marketing skills is to go for the niches and find something specific that you have got a reasonable chance of success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> As you\'re looking back to, do you think there were, where were the catalyst moments when. You know, you\'re, you\'re starting to get a flow in of customers that\'s kind of growing. Um, and like, oh, this point here, when this happened, things started to take off from marketing or customer, you know, incoming customers or things like that, that you think made the difference that you think about quite a bit today in terms of the marketing and growth of [00:33:00] the products that you offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Um, it\'s funny cuz what we do now is kind of the same things that we always did, which is finding content opportunities that fill a gap that isn\'t already catered for and a bit of ads and things like that. So it was just about really getting, there wasn\'t really a catalyst moment because we did that from day one based on experience of marketing the agency business, it\'s more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reducing the randomness as I talked about earlier, and fine tuning that process so that you can predict the chance of success more before you start throwing things out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, I, The first month, that first eight months of item I tell people a lot is that I was doing support cuz I was the only person and um, oh yes, but I cannot take that experience back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would never want to because I learned so much about the who I thought. For, for the tenure, I [00:34:00] was, uh, part of Mythe. I always thought I\'m our, I\'m our base user. I\'m not very technical. I\'m technical enough. I can take a plugin, I can use it, um, but I\'m not gonna get into PHP or anything like that. And that helped us maintain our cut or who we were and what we did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that first eight months was so interesting, just like when I\'ve talked to our agency owners at post status. Um, you, you said this from the beginning, I just kind of assumed, if you like, from the agency mindset, um, you\'d start. And then you\'d hire a full-time person. That\'s a wrong assumption. I\'ve, I\'ve heard over and over you started with contractors or freelancers that helped you with your capacity of the work, and I\'ve heard that so many times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was a nuance because I haven\'t been an agency owner that I learned, but those eight months that I themes, I realized. Um, a couple insights that now in reflection, you know, a long time past, it drove all of our key values because I was getting to understand the actual customers. They were freelancers, [00:35:00] solar printers out there, just kind of doing Lance web, WordPress web design on the side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And eventually it would birth into something like you all did too. Um, and. Just knowing that helped me. And then just seeing the customer. We had a forum at the time. Everybody\'s asking about CSS customization. We would do a theme with the right sidebar. Now remember, don\'t make, this is 2008. So like they\'d, we\'d release a theme with the right sidebar and they\'d say, Well, they wanted on the left, and we\'d help \'em with the css.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was this thing of just noticing and observing what people were actually asking for and putting the head their headset. Headset on and saying, Okay, I wanted to be able to have this flexibility that helped us figure out what next products and what next features we would do because we kept really close to the customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Are there things that in your experience, you\'ve seen too or kind of, It doesn\'t have to be that, but I was trying to give an example to say, I know some of those [00:36:00] things were critical to our success, staying close to the customer, but there are other things that Jesus go, This happened, we learned from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re gonna do that over and over and over. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Um, there\'s a few things to unpick there. We\'ve definitely listened to the customers, not just our initial clients. So I did the support myself for much longer than I should have done until it basically just became unmanageable because it was so many tickets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, but that gave, as you said, that gave me. Such a unique insight into our products and how people are using them so that then I could use that to inform new product decisions, new features, that kind of thing. But even now, we have a support team, which I think is six people as of a couple of weeks ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we have a very comprehensive feature request list for each product where they put things on every days and that we, you know, We got formula again to say, uh, the demand and the difficulty and the impacts and stuff like that, and how [00:37:00] many people are waiting so that I can go in there and see what people are asking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and we have quite a loose interpretation of what makes a feature request. They may not be explicitly asking for something, but if that would meet their need, then we put it on the list, if that makes sense. Um, so we try to be quite, um, open. That so we\'ve got more feedback, um, recorded. So that really helps because you get that insight to, as you say, reduce randomness and know what to build that will work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so for example, tons of our eCommerce product table customers were asking for quick view buttons in their table and they were asking for us to add that to their plugin, which makes sense. Can you add quick view? And we thought, hang. Quick view is not just for product table, that is for any store. You don\'t have to be using the product table layout to want quick V buttons in order to, uh, view more information and add to the cart without [00:38:00] visiting the separate product pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we built a WooCommerce Quick View plugin, which again is still available today, uh, and integrated it with product Table. So when we buy Product Table now, you can either buy it on its own or there\'s like a bundle with Quick View, which quite a lot of customers go for. Um, and you can buy Quick View as a standalone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you would kind of look at what the customers are asking for and then make business decisions around that. Uh, but the other side of what you were saying was about building a team and, um, hiring staff straight away. And because I\'ve always been a bit risk averse, I\'ve waited until we\'re making money, um, until committing, um, particularly big commitments like staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And rather than freelancers. But it\'s interesting seeing more and more at the moment WordPress companies with the more of the startup model where they\'re seeking funding and so on. Cause that\'s something I\'ve got no experience of personally and I\'ve, we just [00:39:00] bootstrapped it, done the work ourselves until we can afford to hire people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and that\'s worked for us. So I watch with interest people with a different model because it\'s like bringing. Big business into WordPress. And you see that more and more the last couple of years, don\'t you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Oh yeah. And, and that was one of the primary drivers for us selling. Um, And being, being acquired is that there is a lot of money, big money coming, coming, continually coming into the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, okay. So Katie, I, we\'ve talked about this past, thank you so much for just sharing that cause I think that\'s so inspiring and helpful for others trying to do. Even just the agency part, you know, And then get to a, what you said, the ceiling and going, Okay, what\'s next? What do we do? And oh, there\'s, there\'s these things that come out and, uh, then the present we\'re born to is now, but what is exciting about you and Barn to in the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\'s getting you revved up about what you\'re doing, where you\'re going and [00:40:00] want to share with others about barn? Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> I think kind of keeping going and, uh, it\'s working, um, doing more, We are getting more ambitious with the sorts of plugins that we will release now. Our SEOs better and we know what works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I still don\'t think I\'d have the confidence to do something really generic like a membership plugin. Um, but we are trying to have a ban to version of all of the Major W. So, for example, last month we launched a filter plugin. Um, actually there isn\'t a major version of that. There\'s a, There wasn\'t, Yeah, that\'s a bad example because there wasn\'t a major, major competitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, that was quite a, it was our most complex plugin that we\'d built. So, um, we were ambitious in that. Sense. And, uh, in the next week or so, we\'re going to launch a, uh, product option plugin. And there is a very strong, um, official version of product add-ons and we, but we\'ve looked at what the gaps are and um, in what ways that plugin is not [00:41:00] like, and, uh, fix that in our own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that\'s exciting to see how that does, um, and just keep, um, doing what we\'re doing. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well Katie, can you tell the, tell, tell listeners where we can find more about you and also Barn two in your work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Um, well the best place is our website, barn two.com. Um, and you can also find us, um, on Twitter at Barn two plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Excellent. And, and also I\'m post out a slack. Um, but I don\'t want people bombarding you, but I know you\'re so generous with your expertise and your success story and everything like that. Katie, thank you so much, uh, for coming along and sharing your story.

Feedback from plugin developers indicates this was an unpopular decision and a failure of communication. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I want to echo disappointed in that chart being removed,&#8221; Equalize Digital CEO Amber Hinds said. &#8220;I hope we&#8217;ll hear something soon. In an ideal world this commit should be rolled back pending community discussion.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach Tirrell, product manager at Liquid Web, said, &#8220;We get very limited metrics from the plugin directory and this one was very important to plugin authors.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden-Chomphosy joined the discussion in the channel but had very little information to offer about why this change was made without any public discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The data shared is always a bit obfuscated so that it’s harder to &#8216;game the system&#8217;—the same reason we don’t have running leaderboards for contributions,&#8221; Haden-Chomphosy said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Suggestions are welcome for how to get some data for you all while doing our best to stick with a &#8216;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition\" target=\"_blank\">co-opetition</a>&#8216; mindset.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-opetition is a term coined to meld the concepts of cooperation and competition to create a system where different vendors cooperate for the benefit of the system while still competing. Haden-Chomphosy did not elaborate but it seems that obfuscating data had been deemed a necessary sacrifice for the sake of co-opetition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Audrey Capital-sponsored meta contributor Scott Reilly, who committed the change, said &#8220;the implementation made it possible to deduce the stats we were looking to obfuscate.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all plugin authors agree that these stats need to be obfuscated, nor do opaque decisions like this one inspire trust in those who are cutting off access to the data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The real data exists,&#8221;  Yoast founder Joost de Valk said. &#8220;Automattic is one of the companies buying plugins and has access to the exact data and now even more than before, others do not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The whole coopetition nonsense is all interesting, but I would say this is an unfair advantage. Literally every other open source system out there just opens these numbers publicly, and so should we.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has still not been confirmed whether this decision was rooted in a security issue, but de Valk and others are imploring WordPress.org&#8217;s decision makers to bring the data back until a suitable alternative in available. Participants on the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511\">ticket</a> have also urged WordPress&#8217; leadership to open a discussion with the plugin developer community about what would data would help them in the creation of an alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Thank you for the feedback, and I do realize that there were a number of third party commercial and free services scraping these data en masse and using it,&#8221; Matt Mullenweg commented on the ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If someone has reasons to bring it back that haven&#8217;t been presented above already, please add it to this thread so we have the best possible presentation of that side of the argument to consider.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a 10-month hiatus from his <a href=\"https://wptrends.co/\">WP Trends</a> newsletter, Iain Poulson returned today with an issue titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://s.wptrends.co/w/kWJrSn4PAY2Xziux1YiYEQ\">Second-Class Third-Party Developers</a>&#8221; that identifies this clawback of active install growth data as &#8220;a symptom of the wider issue that WordPress doesn’t really want to support third-party developers who build freemium plugins.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Because of this, the data insights for developers is severely lacking and it&#8217;s&nbsp;one of the reasons I created&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://pluginrank.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Plugin Rank</a>&nbsp;and why other solutions like&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wpmetrics.dev/\" target=\"_blank\">wpMetrics</a>&nbsp;exist and both will be impacted by this change. That&#8217;s not to say other platforms and marketplaces are perfect, but they don’t seem to work against developers like WordPress.org does. As a plugin developer trying to grow a business, data is everything and the data from the directory&nbsp;is&nbsp;poor and requires a large overhaul&nbsp;to improve what is collected.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poulson contends WordPress.org could even go beyond the previously offered data and add new installs per day/month, how many existing sites updated per day/month, and the search terms leading to the download.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Freemium Plugin developers shouldn’t be treated like second-class citizens in the ecosystem,&#8221; Poulson said. &#8220;Even developers with just free&nbsp;plugins should be able to see decent statistics. There&#8217;s no incentive to keep developing plugins if you don’t know people are using them.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the lack of meaningful data for developers who are trying to monitor the trajectory of their free plugins, the non-transparent decision from the meta team seems to be the greater issue at hand for many participants in the resulting discussions. The sting of another closed-door decision cannot easily be explained away with a fancy portmanteau that promotes cooperation without adequate communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If plugin developers cannot be trusted to act &#8220;co-opetively&#8221; with this data, will WordPress continue collecting it? Who has private access to it? Why weren&#8217;t alternatives explored before silently removing access? These questions need to be answered in the process of finding a way forward for improving plugin data after this decision.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Oct 2022 03:15:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"Post Status: Open Source Communities: You May Not Be Interested in CISA, But CISA is Very Interested in You\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=126155\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:116:\"https://poststatus.com/open-source-communities-you-may-not-be-interested-in-cisa-but-cisa-is-very-interested-in-you/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17588:\"<div class=\"e-content\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-49 wp-block-group eplus-wrapper has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">United States national security interests are poised to become more invested in and engaged with open source projects classified as public infrastructure.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf\">memorandum M-16-21</a> then, which required that all federal agencies open all new custom code for reuse by all other agencies and release 20% or more of any new custom code as free and open source. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things have changed, but not the importance of open source software in government and <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/infrastructure-security\">critical infrastructure</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is risk tolerance, which is <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/importance-tech-government-obamas-chief-staff/\">never high in government</a>, that has diminished greatly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, open source software is increasingly associated with risk, if only because it has become so successful. It\'s a huge attack surface in the middle of a seemingly permanent and escalating cyberwar, a cold war that never ended, or what is more commonly seen now as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-generation_warfare\">fifth-generation warfare</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s logical for government to <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/when-the-free-rider-is-government/\">step in to try to reduce that risk</a>. Since the Apache <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j#Log4Shell_vulnerability\">Log4j/Log4shell vulnerability</a> (<a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228\">Base CVSS score of 10</a>) became public in December 2021, those big wheels have started to turn. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-there-was-a-pretty-big-government-response\">&#8220;There was a pretty big government response&#8221;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A critical vulnerability in the widely used Java logging tool (Log4j, specifically a Log4j 2 dependency, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell\">Log4shell</a>) turned out to have been exploitable for about a decade, giving potential attackers &#8220;easy access to internal networks,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/10/software-flaw-most-critical-vulnerability-log-4-shell\">according</a> to <em>The Guardian</em>. (It even touched WordPress, through Openverse, but was quickly handled <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2022/01/05/journal-entry-log4j-vulnerability/\">as Chloe Bringmann later reported</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often described as the most serious vulnerability in a decade (if not all time), the US government response it motivated was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/22/senators-introduce-bill-protect-open-source-software/\">recently summarized</a> in <em>The Washington Post</em>. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) led that response and will be leading new initiatives regarding open source in the near future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, &#8220;CISA <a href=\"https://www.cyberscoop.com/log4j-cisa-easterly-most-serious/\">briefed industry leaders</a>, issued <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news/2021/12/17/cisa-issues-emergency-directive-requiring-federal-agencies-mitigate-apache-log4j\">an emergency order</a> for federal agencies to patch the issue and <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news/2021/12/22/cisa-fbi-nsa-and-international-partners-issue-advisory-mitigate-apache-log4j\">jointly published an alert</a> with the FBI, National Security Agency and governments around the world.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, all attention turned to future risk mitigation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\">Like <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2021/04/16/wordpress-releases-security-and-maintenance-update\">CISA in the US</a>, the <a href=\"https://cyber.gc.ca/en/cccshomepage\">Canadian Centre for Cyber Security</a> already distributes a vague and clumsy &#8220;WordPress security advisory&#8221; from time to time. Expect it to improve — there\'s a lot of money and jobs for it in the federal pipeline. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who shows up when decisions are being made?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In January this year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned companies to remediate the Log4shell flaw or <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2022/01/ftc-warns-companies-remediate-log4j-security-vulnerability\">face potential legal action</a>. And the White House <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/13/readout-of-white-house-meeting-on-software-security/\">brought in leaders from major tech companies</a> to discuss <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/14/open-source-bugs-present-an-extermination-problem-government/\">what might be done</a> about widely used and under-maintained open source software. Only three organizations represented open source at that meeting, including the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Security_Foundation\">Open Source Security Foundation</a>, a project of the Linux Foundation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress was not publicly represented in these proceedings or any that have followed. In January, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-as-a-commons/\">Lesley Sim</a> and others in the WordPress community asked, &#8220;Who represents our open source commons?&#8221; And the question keeps coming up. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f997.png\" alt=\"🦗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tech Security Experts and Foreign Policy Interests Converge on Software Supply Chains</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/responding-to-and-learning-from-the-log4shell-vulnerability\">a hearing</a> on Log4Shell and open source security in February. The speakers involved, the discussion that took place, and subsequent legislative development indicate federal funding and involvement in open source is coming. It\'s just a matter of when and how much. GovTech did a nice <a href=\"https://www.govtech.com/security/apache-software-foundation-talks-log4j-open-source-security\">summary</a> of the event, but there are some things on the speakers\' prepared statements worth singling out. The Q&A; is also <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/responding-to-and-learning-from-the-log4shell-vulnerability\">worth watching</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>David Nalley, Apache Software Foundation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>David Nalley, President of the Apache Software Foundation, was the first to speak. The words &#8220;non-profit,&#8221; &#8220;charity,&#8221; and &#8220;contributors&#8221; figured early and prominently in Nalley\'s <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony-Nalley-2022-02-08.pdf\">brief statement</a>. (Later &#8220;free riders&#8221; came up in the Q&A.;) He emphasized a need for government investment in software supply chain security and the problem of getting updates out to vulnerable systems. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brad Arkin, Cisco Systems</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/executives/brad-arkin.html\">Brad Arkin</a>, Senior Vice President, Chief Security and Trust Officer for Cisco Systems, also emphasized the need to be able to see the maintenance status of all software in use and make rapid upgrades — without overly focusing on Log4shell or regarding open source as being especially risky.

An academic and lobbyist, he was the only member of the panel not from the tech industry. Notably, the Atlantic Council promotes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanticism\">Atlanticism</a> and has <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/history/\">historic ties to NATO</a> as <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/issue/nato/\">an advocate for NATO interests</a>. Dr. Herr took a slightly more alarmist view of open source as especially risk-prone. In his very goal-oriented, politically savvy statements, he called for DHS through CISA to fund and directly involve itself in the open source community:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This office should further encourage collaboration among the United States and allies in supporting the security of open source projects identified as critical by the office and act as a community liaison/security evangelist for the open-source community across the federal government.</p><cite>&lt;<a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony-Herr-2022-02-08.pdf\">https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony-Herr-2022-02-08.pdf</a>&gt;</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, &#8220;Open-source security should be part of mainstream supply chain security policymaking, and this office would be charged with supporting those efforts while acting as the single point of contact for external stakeholders.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Deep Pockets Ready to Spend</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Herr also pointed to:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8230;<a href=\"https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/LANGEV_068_xml220128115401119.pdf\">a proposed amendment</a> to <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4521\">HR 4521</a>, the America COMPETES Act of 2022, that would authorize the creation of a set of Critical Technology Security Centers inside of DHS [through CISA], including one focused specifically on open-source security. </p><cite>&lt;<a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony-Herr-2022-02-08.pdf\">https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony-Herr-2022-02-08.pdf</a>&gt;</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He then urged the Senators present to support this legislation &#8220;when it reaches the Senate, with the understanding that a substantial portion of moneys appropriated for these centers, on the order of $20 to $30 million a year, is dedicated to this open-source mission.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In subsequent years, Herr predicted hundreds of millions would be spent on open source security by the federal government — all with the goal of: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8230;focusing on secure developer tools and “foundational” infrastructure for the open-source ecosystem, to incentivize rebuilding codebases in memory-safe languages, to support audits and volunteer labor to identify and patch vulnerabilities, and to support efforts to drive security talent into this space and towards the most impactful libraries and packages in open source.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In May, a second Open Source Software Security Summit was held in Washington, DC when &#8220;the Linux Foundation and OpenSSF gathered a cross-section of open source developer and commercial ecosystem representatives along with leaders and experts from key U.S. federal agencies.&#8221; Their goal was to build a mobilization plan — &#8220;a consensus on high-impact actions to take to improve the resiliency and security of open source software.&#8221;  They came up with <a href=\"https://openssf.org/oss-security-mobilization-plan/\">10 areas of focus to improve OSS security</a> and called for immediate funding from the tech industry in the ballpark of USD 150 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Securing Open Source Software Act</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In late September, Senators Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and Republican Rob Portman (R-Ohio) <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4913\">introduced legislation</a> that directs CISA to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&#8220;Hire open-source experts.&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;Publish a framework on open-source code risk&#8221; within a year and then regularly &#8220;perform an assessment of open-source code components that federal agencies commonly use.&#8221;</li><li>Study, within two years, whether their risk assessment framework &#8220;could be used in critical infrastructure outside the government and potentially work with one or more critical infrastructure sectors to voluntarily test the idea.&#8221;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/22/senators-introduce-bill-protect-open-source-software/\">noted</a>, &#8220;Other agencies would have roles as well, such as the Office of Management and Budget publishing guidance to federal chief information officers on the secure use of open-source software.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Open Source Software as Public Infrastructure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trey Herr was <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/majority-media/peters-and-portman-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-help-secure-open-source-software_\">very positive</a> about the Peters-Portman Act, saying:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“This important&nbsp;legislation&nbsp;will,&nbsp;for the first&nbsp;time ever, codify&nbsp;open source software as public infrastructure. If signed into law, it would serve as a historic step&nbsp;for wider federal support for the health and security of open source software.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While it may not be possible to rush through Congress before it\'s out of session this year, it seems very likely the Act will drive greater self-regulation in open source — and bring in new government requirements to comply with. Parallel developments are happening in Europe where investment in open source as a public good has advocates arguing it leads to <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/study-about-impact-open-source-software-and-hardware-technological-independence-competitiveness-and\">nearly a hundredfold return</a>. Opportunities will surely emerge from new sources of funding and jobs for open source, but national and regional geopolitics may complicate the nature of contribution within truly global and international projects. </p>\n</div><p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Oct 2022 19:22:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"<span class=\'p-author h-card\'>Dan Knauss</span>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 40: All Things Testing with Special Guests Anne McCarthy and Brian Alexander\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=13551\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:119:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/episode-40-all-things-testing-with-special-guests-anne-mccarthy-and-brian-alexander/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36353:\"<p>In the fortieth episode of the WordPress Briefing, Josepha Haden Chomphosy sits down with special guests Anne McCarthy and Brian Alexander to discuss the Testing Team and how to get started with testing in the WordPress project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have with us today on the WordPress Briefing a couple of special guests. I have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ironprogrammer/\">Brian Alexander</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\">Anne McCarthy</a>. I&#8217;m gonna ask you both to tell us a little bit about yourselves, if you can tell us what you do with the WordPress project, maybe how long you&#8217;ve been with WordPress, and if there are any particular teams that you contribute to, that would be great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian, why don&#8217;t you get us started?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:01:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Brian. I work on the WordPress project as a full-time contributor, sponsored by Automattic. And I am one of the Test Team reps, so I help promote testing across the project. And that&#8217;s not just in Core, but it could be for Themes, Performance, feature plugins, what have you. So try to make that stuff move forward and wrangle as many people as we can to get on board and help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. All right, and Anne, what about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:01:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spearhead the Full Site Editing outreach program. I am a sponsor contributor for Automattic as well, and so I contribute across a couple of different teams depending upon what the outreach program needs as well as various release squads I have been a part of. So for 6.1 coming up, I&#8217;m one of the co-Core Editor triage leads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian is also on the squad as the co-Test lead, which is very exciting. So it&#8217;s been fun to work with him and be on the podcast. And I&#8217;ve been around the WordPress project since about 2011. But this is, the last couple of years, the first time I&#8217;ve been able to be sponsored by Automattic and be a part of giving back to the community that&#8217;s given me so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazing. All right. For folks who&#8217;ve been listening to the WP Briefing for a while, you know that I&#8217;ve been saying for like a full year that I think that testing is one of the best onboarding opportunities we have. And then also I really like to bring in our co-creators of WordPress through that testing program. Because we don&#8217;t know whether we&#8217;re right or not unless people tell us that we&#8217;re right or not. And we would like to hear so much from the users who, you know, use it and don&#8217;t necessarily have an opportunity, that privilege to kind of build on it or build the CMS itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I just have a few questions since I&#8217;ve got a couple of our strong testing wranglers here. The first thing I have is what are you doing? Or, do you have any advice for getting people outside of our active contributor base and the community to participate in testing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:03:03]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can kick this off. Just thinking about the Full Site Editing outreach program model. So just for context, there are various calls for testing in different formats. So everything from really procedural where you&#8217;re following exact steps to follow, to very open-ended calls for testing, as well as we recently did usability testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the things that come to mind immediately just for getting different contributors is to have very specific, fun, engaging, relevant tests that can draw people in. So if you have a call for testing that really speaks to someone, they might be more willing to participate. As well as just different formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So someone may not want to, you know, follow 30 steps, but they might want to follow something more open-ended. They might want to answer a survey rather than opening a GitHub link. And so I think a lot of facilitation with the outreach program has served us really well to bring in different folks as well as explicitly reaching out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve done a number of talks in different WordPress related spaces and non-WordPress spaces to try to tell people about what we&#8217;re up to and really go meet them where they are. Because I think that&#8217;s ultimately, especially with Covid and the pandemic, there was a really unique opportunity to do that and to join the random online meetup that was happening and talk about the program and talk about ways that people could get involved and feel heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:04:12]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the last thing I&#8217;ll mention is translations. The program that&#8217;s culture testing that I write is written in English, but I&#8217;m very fortunate to have people who translate those. And so that&#8217;s a huge way that I cannot contribute but that other people have. And so I really want to highlight that and call that out because it&#8217;s been hugely impactful to have these calls for testing in a way that people can more readily access.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:04:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I was going to add in, in addition to the calls for testing that are, as Anne said, structured such to isolate so that someone can just kind of go through a list of steps to do rather than just being exposed to Trac or GitHub and have kind of snow blindness with, with everything that&#8217;s happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a Week in Test series of posts that goes out about every week. And what we try to do with that series is to curate a list of posts that might be a good starting point. So we try to find one that, in each type of testing example, is something that would, a more novice contributor might be able to start with. Things for more intermediate and then also advanced ones that, for testers who may need to have a development environment and the ability to make some pretty deep or type of customizations to their WordPress project in order to test a patch or reproduce a particular issue that might be happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a good springboard for someone to come in where there&#8217;s just a small thing that they can kind of look at and then dive into the larger process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. That&#8217;s very smart. It&#8217;s hard to figure out how to get started in WordPress at all, let alone as a contributing by testing things sort of area. That feels new to WordPress even though the team has been around for a long time. And so I think that&#8217;s excellent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian, you mentioned in your note about who you are and what you&#8217;re doing that you&#8217;re helping with testing not only in the test section in the Test Team but then also across the project. So, I have a follow-up question for you. What can developers do to create better tests for their software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:06:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are sections within the Core handbook that kind of go into detail about the types of tests that should accompany individual contributions. A lot of those require kind of an extra step, and some developers maybe don&#8217;t have as much experience there. So hopefully, the Core handbook can provide a little bit of that guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a lot of contributors who are interested in things such as unit testing, E2E testing, which is end-to-end testing, and testing in JavaScript or in PHP. So there&#8217;s a wide variety of the types of tests that you can actually contribute to. And I would say maybe about 50% of the tickets that I&#8217;ve triaged, personally, the contributor who brought in the patch was unable to or was not familiar with providing unit tests. So that is a very good opportunity for someone to come in who maybe is not as well versed in the depth of what the patch was involved with. But by contributing a user test, they get an opportunity to look very focused at a particular piece of code, what was modified, and then create unit tests based on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:07:40]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then once that unit test has been submitted and starting to be reviewed, other reviewers, Core contributors, or Core committers, I would say, they&#8217;ll start looking at that and if there are additional details that should be there, expanding the tests or little modifications. Then that also is feedback to that test contributor so that the next time they come in, they&#8217;re more prepared for it. They&#8217;re learning more about Core, and eventually, maybe they&#8217;ll also become a Core contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:07]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. We will include links to these handbook pages and documentation in the show notes if you&#8217;re listening to the podcast on your favorite podcasting platform, Pocketcasts, or it&#8217;s somewhere else. I don&#8217;t know where people listen to podcasts, but if you&#8217;re listening to it somewhere that&#8217;s not on the website, you can come to get that on wordpress.org/news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, the next question that I have, and I think this is for both of you, Brian, it sounds like you partially answered it, but I bet there are more answers from Anne as well. What advice do you have for those submitting bug reports?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:08:38]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll chime in to start, and then Brian, I&#8217;d love to hear your unique take because I also think you do an excellent job whenever I&#8217;ve engaged with you in various places of providing really good replication steps. And so I love that, and I wanna offer things specific to WordPress itself and something that I&#8217;ve noticed that&#8217;s more cultural rather than necessarily like steps to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the things I&#8217;ve noticed that I think has started to come up partially with Covid is people, you know, you start talking at WordCamps or at a meetup, and a bug comes up, and you find someone who knows where to put it, and that kind of connection is has been frayed in the last couple years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so one of the things I feel like I&#8217;ve been saying to a lot of different people at this unique point in time is that it doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect. Don&#8217;t let perfect be the enemy of good. And so if it means you just need to drop it in a Slack channel and you just are like, I don&#8217;t know where to put this, that&#8217;s huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to hear from people across the project. And I just really encourage anyone, even if you don&#8217;t have the complete information or you&#8217;re not a hundred percent sure you&#8217;re afraid it&#8217;s been reported 10 times before, like, please still report it because we need those reports and also if 10 people reported it and it&#8217;s still not fixed, that also means we need to iterate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:09:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s one of the things, especially with the Full Site Editing outreach program, I feel people will message me saying, hey, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard this a bunch, but… And sometimes I&#8217;ve never heard it at all. And I shudder to think of all the people who have not reached out or have not posted in GitHub or Trac or wherever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, share, and write blog posts. I think that another great way that people can give feedback is if you don&#8217;t know how to get into the depths of WordPress, writing a post and talking about it and sharing it on social media is also a great way to get attention. I read a lot of those. But as much as possible, getting to, if you can, if you&#8217;re comfortable, getting to the source where we&#8217;re able to see it in Github or Trac goes a really long way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And share as much as you can. And don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t spend hours writing the perfect bug report, we still wanna hear from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:10:21]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Building off of what Anne said, just the fact that you&#8217;re speaking out and raising an issue is a huge step for many, many people. And once, once you&#8217;ve actually done that, as Anne said, it doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect. There are a lot of other people who are going to be looking at these bugs, trying to figure out the replication steps used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even if you can&#8217;t provide all this detail up front, someone will help. On the back end, they&#8217;ll help kind of fill in those gaps. If you do have the time to actually get deep into providing a very detailed bug report, then there are some key aspects of the bug report that make it very helpful for contributors, not only testers, who should be able to reproduce the issue to validate and make sure that this isn&#8217;t something that&#8217;s unique, unique to a plugin, to a custom theme or snippet that you dropped into your functions PHP.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, also for the actual Core contributors, who then need to be able to understand what is happening so that they can fix the right thing. And some of those items are the information about your testing environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:11:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that could be your browser, your server, the type, whether it&#8217;s Apache, Nginx, et cetera, the operating system you&#8217;re running, what version of PHP you&#8217;re running, the version of WordPress, very critical, and…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:49]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:11:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any themes and plugins that you&#8217;re using. And that kind of information helps set the stage, and then other people will be able to set up their environment similarly if they&#8217;re going to try to test it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you have provided the environmental information, the steps required to reproduce the issue should be as detailed as possible. You may not have realized that clicking this caused such and such to happen, so just try to remember, or maybe even walk through if it&#8217;s something you can repeat multiple times, walk through a couple of times and write down everything that you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:12:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that you&#8217;re sure, hey, this is the way that I can reproduce this bug. And then those steps will be very helpful for other contributors when they&#8217;re reviewing it. And then it&#8217;s also very helpful if you have video, screenshots, debug logs, any of those other kinds of resources that you could refer to because not all bugs are easy to explain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we tend to… Trac and GitHub issues for the Gutenberg project, everybody&#8217;s writing in English. And maybe your main language is not English, and it might be a little bit challenging to do that. So providing a video, it&#8217;s worth a thousand words in any language. So, if you can provide those types of assets, that&#8217;s also very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and I&#8217;ll share a little bit of a you&#8217;re-not-alone-in-it sort of anecdotes from the first few bugs that I ever filed for WordPress. I sort of had this feeling that if I were to file a bug, everyone would know that I wasn&#8217;t a developer. And like everyone knows, I&#8217;m not a developer, but a little bit I was like, they&#8217;ll know now. And so if that&#8217;s where you are also,&nbsp; Anne said it, and Brian said it as well, like, we can&#8217;t fix things that we don&#8217;t realize are broken. And just because you&#8217;ve run into it 15 times, which obviously should never happen, you should run into it once, and then we know, but it happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run into it 15 times, probably other people have as well. And if it&#8217;s still not fixed, it might be because no one has thought to themselves I should tell someone that&#8217;s broken. And so if that&#8217;s your primary hurdle, folks out there in our listening space, I was once there too. And honestly, knowing that it&#8217;s a problem is as valuable as knowing the solution to it most of the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:14:23]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and those are, I wanted to add, there is a lot to that to remember. That&#8217;s a lot to remember in terms of what you should be submitting, what, or I should say, what would be ideal in what you&#8217;re submitting. But luckily, in the test handbook, there&#8217;s a test report section, and it includes a description, it goes everything from, it starts with why we do bug reports to examples of the types of testing, whether it be for bugs or enhancements, which also need testing, and it has templates in there that you can copy and paste directly into Trac. And that&#8217;s very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah,, we will have links to those in the show notes as well. Since we&#8217;re right there at that moment, what do you think we could do as WordPress to make reporting problems easier?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:15:15]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that this has been something that&#8217;s come up during our weekly meetings, discussions on the Core test channel, as well as in contributor day test table discussions. And the test documentation that&#8217;s on the website is a little bit fragmented. I believe that the current test handbook was originally written for a type of flow analysis and feedback testing that is not the norm today. So it&#8217;s a little bit confusing. The terminology is a little dated, and the most recent updates that have been provided on there relate solely to Gutenberg, which is very important that that also be represented, but, in order to find information about testing and Trac or PHP unit tests, you have to go over to the core handbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we could definitely make things improved by consolidating, bringing everything into one area so that if you are interested in testing, you&#8217;ll have everything in one place and not be split between that and not have outdated methodologies that are asking you to submit videos that nobody&#8217;s going to really look at because we&#8217;re not doing the flow tests anymore. So I think that that would be a benefit to future testers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:41]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne, any thoughts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:16:43]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I&#8217;ll also add that I think there are like two things we can do. One is, there&#8217;s so much happening in the WordPress project in such a cool way that I think the more we can write targeted tests and talk to people about, like, hey, here&#8217;s this new thing coming. This is a high-impact area to test. It&#8217;s under active iteration. You&#8217;re gonna get a lot of engagement. People are really thinking about this and pulling people into that where you kind of get the momentum of getting the feedback in right when someone needs it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we could do that a bit more to make reporting problems easier because it&#8217;s kind of like you&#8217;re in the thick of it with a lot of people rather than maybe exploring an area where someone hasn&#8217;t looked at it in a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that’s the thing that comes to mind is just the more we can take the time. I think this release cycle has been really good with that, where there&#8217;s been a call for testing for fluid typography. There&#8217;s also been one for using block template parts and classic themes. And there&#8217;s a ton of stuff that&#8217;s been happening where we can kind of make these both developer and more end user testing experiences easier and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Brian has done a great job continuing the tradition of, you know, helping test this latest release cycle. And he&#8217;s taken those posts and done an amazing job of helping, having specific testing as well. Tied to this, I think just this has always been a thing but better, easier testing environments for developers and for quickly setting up more WordPress sites to test things for end users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:17:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Another thing that we have been discussing in Slack in the Core and Core Test channels is the possibility of pre-populating the Trac tickets. With a template based on what it is that you&#8217;re reporting. So similar to copying a template for a test report out of the handbook. Instead, you would hit a button to say the type of bug you are submitting, and then it would pre-populate that, and then you could fill in the gaps for that. This already happens over in Gutenberg. There, there are templates, and I find that that is very helpful. And so being able to do that in Trac would be useful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for reporting problems on the user side, I thought that it would be interesting to have like you have for any other modern app, a button that says Report Bug in WordPress that could capture some intelligence data for your installation, the page that you&#8217;re on and have a simple text box where you could provide a little description and then submit that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:19:08]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, these wouldn&#8217;t be the types of things that would just go straight into Trac, most likely. However, it would be an opportunity to allow end users to just send something in, and start having it looked at, rather than looking and saying, okay, I found a bug in WordPress. Now, what do I do?&nbsp; And then not reporting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that would be the worst case is that the bug just doesn&#8217;t get reported. So that would be information that is already harvested if you go to your site health screen and your WordPress installation. A lot of that information that would be useful is there. In this type of bug report, we would want to anonymize and strip a lot of that information out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of private stuff you don&#8217;t wanna share, but there is that data there that&#8217;s available that could potentially help in doing a bug report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:19:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brilliant. All right. Question for everyone in the room: what opportunities are there currently to help with testing? Anne, I know, and you already mentioned a few, we can just bombard everybody with links to the tests if we want. But yeah, what opportunities are currently out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:20:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ll mention the Full Site Editing outreach program. I&#8217;m very biased, but we&#8217;re always looking for new folks. We just crossed, I think, 600 people, which was unbelievable. So even if you&#8217;re not necessarily always able to help join the calls for testing, you can always pop into the FSE outreach experiment channel, which we&#8217;ll also add a link to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s just a great way when you have time to join because I flag stuff all the time, whether it&#8217;s about the outreach program or just in general across the project. Brian does really good weekly round-up testing posts as well. So make.wordpress.org/test is also a great place to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then right now, I think when this comes out, will be a great time to be helping test WordPress 6.1. So check out that post. I kind of wanna just shove everyone in that direction currently cause I think that&#8217;s the most high-impact thing to get involved with and one of the great ways to give back to the next version of WordPress to make it really delightful and easy to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m just gonna leave it there, even though there are so many ways you can help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 coming out on November 1st if you haven&#8217;t yet heard about it. Brian, what else have you got out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:21:16]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the online stuff, Anne covered that pretty well. I would say if you have a local WordCamp, sign up for their contributor day or if there are any local WordPress meetups. When Covid ended up hitting and lockdowns were rolled out, a lot of this stuff started to really slow down. So I think now is a good time to maybe introduce the idea for, hey, let&#8217;s have a local meetup, and for a couple of hours, we&#8217;ll just do some testing, and look at some stuff in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it might be a good way of getting people re-engaged. It&#8217;s a little bit lighter weight if you&#8217;re doing testing versus trying to actually provide a patch to fix an issue. So, might be a good way of bringing in some new faces and re-engaging people who we lost over the lockdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:22:09]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and if you all have never done a testing party for WordPress before, and it sounds like it&#8217;s maybe a really boring thing, it&#8217;s actually not, she said with strong authority and opinions. But also, I have never had a more successful learning experience with the WordPress CMS than when I was trying to figure it out with other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They see things that you don&#8217;t see, they know things you don&#8217;t know, and it really covers a lot of the bases for unknown unknowns when you&#8217;re trying to learn something. And then also you have all these people that like, we’re really in it with you, and everyone&#8217;s really pulling for each other, and it&#8217;s actually a bit more fun than it sounds like when you&#8217;re just like, a testing party. It turns into just like jointly solving a puzzle together, which I think sounds like a lot of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like a party, but for technology, I would feel this way. I am a mad extrovert, and we all know it, but. Now you two know it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:23:08]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a final, just like a fun question for you both, and if you have an answer, great. And if you don&#8217;t have an answer, I would be surprised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here we go. Last question of the day. If five more volunteers suddenly appeared to help on the Test Team, what would they do? Just, I waved a magic wand. I guess that&#8217;s what made it fun. I don&#8217;t know why. I was like, fun question and then I&#8217;m, like, assigned tasks that, Yeah, I waved a magic wand. That&#8217;s what made it fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:23:38]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I would say I would probably point them to FSE outreach program posts because…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:23:45]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woot woot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:23:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…the outreach program does a great job of outlining steps. You&#8217;re isolating testing in one particular area. It&#8217;s got a lot of tests. There&#8217;s examples of the types of feedback that you&#8217;re looking for, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a really good introduction to it, and most FSE testing does not require a local dev environment. Which is probably the biggest hurdle for a new tester coming in. If you do have developers with more experience, then they could start–and they wanted to look into Trac tickets or GitHub issues– then it does take a little bit of setup and you may spend the next few hours configuring your development environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead, I would recommend that you start with something like FSE outreach program posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:24:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did not pay Brian to say that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:24:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re just all partial to it here. That&#8217;s all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:24:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, we really are. Yeah, no, this is, I love this question, and I actually find it really fun cause I think about it a lot. And we&#8217;ve talked about some of this stuff too, and it&#8217;s something that when I think about five more people suddenly appearing, makes me giddy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we have folks, who have helped with like, I think I&#8217;ve mentioned like translations and group testing and even responding to questions that come from the channel and like, I just wish if we had five folks full time dedicated to that, I could see way more hallway hangouts where we casually talk about stuff and actually go on a call and talk live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could see folks, someone dedicated to helping translations and translating even more places. We have an Italian contributor who does it regularly, and a couple of Japanese contributors every once in awhile we get Spanish translation. But I&#8217;d love to see more translations to bring more people in, more facilitating group testing, more types of testing, helping me be more creative because sometimes I get a creative wall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But more than anything, if I really think long term about the project and thinking about this outreach program model, which I don&#8217;t think I fully appreciated how new it was, Josepha, when you introduced the idea, I think it would be so neat to bring in more folks to actually create new outreach programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:25:52]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe there&#8217;s an outreach program for theme authors or block theme authors, or maybe there&#8217;s an outreach program around collaborative editing. Like what does this look like, and how can we expand this to bring more people in? And I think a lot of that will prove the resiliency and lessons we&#8217;ve learned from Covid in the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can&#8217;t necessarily always rely on the meetup groups, so how can we meet people where they are? And I think there&#8217;s something really interesting and almost serendipitous that the outreach program started literally, I think it was like May 2020, like a couple of months into the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, like, I want to see it in a position of strength where we both have the in-person community alongside this outreach program model that can intertwine work. And I&#8217;d love to see the model expand to different types. And right now, maybe part of that is we use the outreach program model, the full site editing outreach program group itself, to experiment more and to keep that level of experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something I feel really strongly about is continuing to find what works and what doesn&#8217;t. And so if we had five more people, I could just, I&#8217;d probably go wild and have all sorts of cool, cool things and spinoffs, but I&#8217;m more introverted than Josepha, so there&#8217;s limitations to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:56]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you heard it here first. If you&#8217;re one of my 6,000 listeners. I only need five of one of you. Five of the ones of you to come and make Anne&#8217;s whole life an exciting joy for the next 12 months. So, I only need five of you and I know that you&#8217;re out there. There are 2000 or something, 6,000. I have no idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got more than 1000 of you listening, and I know that you wanna come and help Anne cuz she&#8217;s a delight. I know you wanna come help Brian cuz he&#8217;s a delight. Both of you. This was such a fun conversation. Thank you for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:27:29]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, Josepha. Thank you, Anne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:27:31]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:27:33]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there it is a bit of a deep dive on the Test Team and how to get started on it. Like I mentioned, we&#8217;ll have a ton of links in the show notes over on wordpress.org/news. And I wanna remind folks that if you have questions or thoughts that you&#8217;d like to hear from me about, you can always email us at WPbriefing@wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. First and foremost, we are counting down the days to the WordPress 6.1 release. We are within a month of the target release date. So if you have not tested the latest version with your plugins or themes, now is the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, we are seeing translated tutorials being submitted on learn.wordpress.org. I&#8217;m delighted to see that happening, and I encourage any polyglots out there who feel called to consider translating one into your language and help other people feel empowered to use WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing is that the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India just concluded, so to celebrate, we&#8217;ve opened registrations for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in Latin America. Unlike the last one, this event takes place in person on October 29th. And so I&#8217;ll include a link to registrations for that in the show notes as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.

Important (and some familiar) questions are emerging as this story unfolds: how to balance the values of openness, security, and privacy as well as cooperation and competition at WordPress.org — still the central hub for WordPress plugin businesses. </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">On September 29, changesets <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12097\">12097</a> and <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12098\">12098</a> were committed to the Meta Trac repository for wordpress.org by Scott Reilly (Audrey Capital). These changes remove the Active Install Growth chart from the plugin repository\'s &#8220;Advanced&#8221; section on individual plugins. The only explanation given by Scott is &#8220;insufficient data obfuscation.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These changes are simply a reversion of the code that Alex Shiels (Automattic) added  to create the section with active install data back in 2017. Alex\'s ticket for improvements to the &#8220;Advanced&#8221; view (#<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3016\">3106</a>) includes other additions to public plugin data that were never implemented due to concerns over the potential for them to be &#8220;gamed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-plugin-owners-respond\">Plugin Owners Respond</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On September 30, Mark Zahra opened Trac ticket #<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511\">6511</a> &#8220;Bring back the active install growth chart&#8221; to express its importance to plugin owners and to request improvements rather than deletion. Discussions were already taking place in Make WordPress #<a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1664524515185589\">meta</a>, on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markzahra/status/1576337548502528000\">Twitter</a>, and in Post Status #<a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C0413T6GD/p1664528945421999\">business</a>, where Mark shared his ticket. At Post Status, a discussion was already happening about the challenges of entering the plugin repo and succeeding there since Vito Peleg had just launched Atarim\'s freemium <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/atarim-visual-collaboration/\">Visual Collaboration</a> plugin at wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Abuse Comes to Light But Details Aren\'t Clear Yet</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>For some time now, it\'s been a common and reasonable assumption in the WordPress business community that some of the bigger plugin owners have very accurate data on their plugins\' usage as well as their competitors — enough to create a &#8220;leaderboard&#8221; to assess the effectiveness of sales campaigns or to see a buying opportunity in others\' declining install figures.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Abuse of the active install growth chart has been an issue in the past. Barış Ünver\'s article, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/the-decline-of-speed-booster-pack/\">The Decline of Speed Booster Pack</a>, touches on an incident where several hundred plugins had their install stats artificially inflated, mostly to mask the perpetrator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abuse seems to be an issue again but of a different type. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha Haden Chomphosy joined the #meta discussion and said Marius Jensen was approximately correct in guessing &#8220;the active install growth could be (was being?) used to determine near exact numbers, making the intended obfuscation pointless.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The data shared is always a bit obfuscated so that it’s harder to “game the system” — the same reason we don’t have running leaderboards for contributions.</p><cite>Josepha haden Chomphosy &lt;<a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1664559896577109\">https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1664559896577109</a>&gt;</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Security or Privacy? Or Security <em>and</em> Privacy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In reply to Mark\'s ticket, John James Jacoby affirmed there had been, <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3016#comment:12\">in Michael Nelson\'s words</a>, a &#8220;closed-door security or privacy decision taken by a larger group.&#8221; The active install growth charts were not pulled on a whim by a single individual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsored by Awesome Motive, John is a full-time contributor to the Core, Documentation, and Meta teams. He says he independently reviewed the code generating the data for the active install chart which he noted &#8220;is outside of the Meta repository&#8221; with other &#8220;code  responsible for keeping WordPress.org running.&#8221; None of this code is &#8220;publicly available,&#8221; but he &#8220;independently identified precisely why these charts were removed the way that they were,&#8221; and he &#8220;would not have made any different decisions had [he] been in on the decision-making process.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John added he doesn\'t &#8220;have any doubts that [improvement and not removal] is the long-term goal&#8221; for the active install growth chart. Further, he added that fast, private action was called for and &#8220;is not intended to hurt your community of users.&#8221; Instead, the intention is to &#8220;[exclude] many people to protect them from some people.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, in #Meta, John specified two future options for the return of Active Install data:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Private by default, and optionally made public by plugin authors on a per-plugin basis.</p><p>A GUI could be invented to allow plugin authors to add usernames with access to the stats, similar to how it works for the support forums.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Active Install Data Matters </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Active installs are the only way plugin owners can estimate the number of sites that are using their free plugin — and assess growth or decline over time. As Joost de Valk noted on Mark\'s ticket, &#8220;The <em>trends</em> in this data are <strong>super</strong> important for plugin developers, as seen by the many many people that have responded to <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1664525003424199\">this in [WordPress] Slack</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By monitoring many plugins across the repo, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/are-active-installs-of-wordpress-plugins-declining-in-2021/\">market trends can be assessed</a> as well. Doing this work manually for even a single plugin is <a href=\"https://benjaminintal.com/2020/09/12/how-to-get-the-actual-number-of-active-installs-of-your-wordpress-plugin/\">quite a chore</a>. Iain Poulson, who is now at WP Engine, <a href=\"https://pluginrank.com/true-active-installs-and-more/\">automated and improved on</a> that process for Plugin Rank, which is now an Awesome Motive product. wpMetric offers <a href=\"https://wpmetrics.dev/blog/plugin-actual-active-installs\">a similar analysis</a>. So does WPDesk\'s <a href=\"https://activeinstalls.com/\">Active Installs</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some time now, it\'s been a common and reasonable assumption in the WordPress business community that some of the bigger plugin owners have very accurate data on their (and their competitors\') plugins\' usage — enough to create a &#8220;leaderboard&#8221; to assess the effectiveness of sales campaigns or see a buying opportunity in others\' declining install figures. Josepha and John are clearly opposed to that happening, certainly in a public way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Healthy Co-opetition Is Not a Leaderboard</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflecting on some early BuddyPress history, John shared how that project\'s &#8220;original primary concern&#8221; had been:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8230;revealing active install charts & graphs for all plugins & themes may not actually be healthy for the entire community, because it is impossible to resist using that single number to speculate about things those numbers may or may not imply – quality, security, performance, earnings, success, etc&#8230; and when that scales to inevitably comparing data across multiple plugins & themes, is any of that actually healthy, positive, or a real goal?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>John also addressed Joost\'s sharpest criticism that &#8220;Automattic has an unfair competitive advantage because they have access to more accurate stats,&#8221; while everyone else is now fully in the dark. (Joost made this claim on several channels, and  it\'s a continuing thread in #<a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1664620909150329\">meta</a>.) </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I will go one step farther and say, that if a goal with any data is to be fair to each other with it, that includes a responsibility to serve up the same data with the same interface to everyone, and to <em>prevent people from accessing it in any way that is unintended or unfair</em>.<br /><br />&#8230;which is essentially what has happened, here.</p><cite>JJJ &lt;<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:5\">https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:5</a>&gt;</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Open to all — <em>for all who want to be open</em> — seems to be the way the issue will be resolved, probably to a near consensus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But will enough data be available to satisfy those who feel like &#8220;Second-Class Third-Party Developers,&#8221; as Iain Poulson put it <a href=\"https://s.wptrends.co/w/kWJrSn4PAY2Xziux1YiYEQ\">in his WP Trends newsletter this morning</a>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deepest issues will likely remain divisive — perceived competitive advantages, the definition of healthy competition in an open source ecosystem, and who gets to referee these things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha emphasized that &#8220;suggestions are welcome for how to get some data for you all while doing our best to stick with a &#8216;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">co-opetition</a>&#8216; mindset.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511\">Reply on Mark\'s ticket</a> if you have helpful contributions to make toward that goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-50 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 id=\"questions\">Worthwhile questions that (re-)emerged in these events:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Can active install data collection be improved and explained</strong> sufficiently to indicate what it measures and how accurate it is — without revealing too much information that could be abused? What is the best balance of care, openness, and awareness that abuse will always happen, sooner or later?</li><li><strong>Can decisions like pulling active install data (along with the people and processes involved in those decisions) be more transparent</strong> and publicly defined to avoid the confusion, injury, and distrust that often results? As a matter of internal public relations, could there be people tasked with explaining delicate issues that can\'t (immediately) be explained fully in a public way? (As opposed to hints and guesses in Slack.)</li><li><strong>Same question for WordPress.org #forum policies</strong> on moderation, reviews, replies to reviews, and other things plugin owners care about. Without being too open (due to the risk of &#8220;gaming&#8221;), can clearer guidance be given to onboard new plugin owners at .org? E.g, how reviews are validated, why they may be removed, and how to appeal their removal? Or how plugin owners and their support staff should avoid or deal with being put under moderation?</li><li><strong>What are winning growth strategies for plugin owners </strong>that aren\'t dependent or overly focused on single measures of success — whether they use the .org repo or not? What are the best ways to go all-in with .org? Or is that simply a mistake?</li><li><strong>How does/doesn\'t the inclusion of all wp.org plugins in the new wp.com marketplace affect active install stats?</strong> Are these combined or separate numbers? What data is available from wp.com to free and commercial plugin owners about their installs there?</li></ul>\n</div></div>\n</div><p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Oct 2022 05:01:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"<span class=\'p-author h-card\'>Dan Knauss</span>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:121:\"Gutenberg Times: Content-only editing for patterns, Learn to use Data Layer in WordPress and more – Weekend Edition 231\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=22274\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:127:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/content-only-editing-for-patterns-learn-to-use-data-layer-in-wordpress-and-more-weekend-edition-231/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17168:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for the check-ins after Hurricane Ian aimed for Southwest Florida, and made landfall on Wednesday.
